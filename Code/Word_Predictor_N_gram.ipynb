Almost omnipotent, he, in the realm of\\r\\nhis people. Dango, Sheeta, even Numa the mighty were as naught to the\\r\\npachyderm. For a hundred years he had come and gone up and down the\\r\\nland that had trembled to the comings and the goings of his forebears\\r\\nfor countless ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn peace he had lived with Dango the hyena, Sheeta the leopard and Numa\\r\\nthe lion. Man alone had made war upon him. Man, who holds the unique\\r\\ndistinction among created things of making war on all living creatures,\\r\\neven to his own kind. Man, the ruthless; man, the pitiless; man, the\\r\\nmost hated living organism that Nature has evolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways during the long hundred years of his life, Tantor had known\\r\\nman. There had been black men, always. Big black warriors with spears\\r\\nand arrows, little black warriors, swart Arabs with crude muskets and\\r\\nwhite men with powerful express rifles and elephant guns. The white men\\r\\nhad been the last to come and were the worst. Yet Tantor did not hate\\r\\nmen--not even white men. Hate, vengeance, envy, avarice, lust are a few\\r\\nof the delightful emotions reserved exclusively for Nature\\'s noblest\\r\\nwork--the _lower_ animals do not know them. Neither do they know fear\\r\\nas man knows it, but rather a certain bold caution that sends the\\r\\nantelope and the zebra, watchful and wary, to the water hole with the\\r\\nlion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTantor shared this caution with his fellows and avoided men--especially\\r\\nwhite men; and so had there been other eyes there that day to see,\\r\\ntheir possessor might almost have questioned their veracity, or\\r\\nattributed their error to the half-light of the forest as they scanned\\r\\nthe figure sprawling prone upon the rough back of the elephant, half\\r\\ndozing in the heat to the swaying of the great body; for, despite the\\r\\nsun-bronzed hide, the figure was quite evidently that of a white man.\\r\\nBut there were no other eyes to see and Tantor drowsed in the heat\\r\\nof midday and Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, dozed upon the back of his\\r\\nmighty friend. A sultry air current moved sluggishly from the north,\\r\\nbringing to the keen nostrils of the ape-man no disquieting perception.\\r\\nPeace lay upon the jungle and the two beasts were content.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the forest Fahd and Motlog, of the tribe el-Harb, hunted north from\\r\\nthe menzil of Sheik Ibn Jad of the Beny Salem fendy el-Guad. With them\\r\\nwere black slaves. They advanced warily and in silence upon the fresh\\r\\nspoor of el-fil the elephant, the thoughts of the swart \\'Aarab dwelling\\r\\nupon ivory, those of the black slaves upon fresh meat. The \\'abd\\r\\nFejjuan, black Galla slave, sleek, ebon warrior, eater of raw meat,\\r\\nfamed hunter, led the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFejjuan, as his comrades, thought of fresh meat, but also he thought\\r\\nof el-Habash, the land from which he had been stolen as a boy. He\\r\\nthought of coming again to the lonely Galla hut of his parents. Perhaps\\r\\nel-Habash was not far off now. For months Ibn Jad had been traveling\\r\\nsouth and now he had come east for a long distance. El-Habash must be\\r\\nnear. When he was sure of that his days of slavery would be over and\\r\\nIbn Jad would have lost his best Galla slave.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo marches to the north, in the southern extremity of Abyssinia, stood\\r\\nthe round dwelling of the father of Fejjuan, almost on the roughly\\r\\nmapped route that Ibn Jad had planned nearly a year since when he had\\r\\nundertaken this mad adventure upon the advice of a learned Sahar, a\\r\\nmagician of repute. But of either the exact location of his father\\'s\\r\\nhouse or the exact plans of Ibn Jad, Fejjuan was equally ignorant. He\\r\\nbut dreamed, and his dreams were flavored with raw meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leaves of the forest drowsed in the heat above the heads of the\\r\\nhunters. Beneath the drowsing leaves of other trees a stone\\'s throw\\r\\nahead of them Tarzan and Tantor slept, their perceptive faculties\\r\\nmomentarily dulled by the soothing influence of fancied security and\\r\\nthe somnolence that is a corollary of equatorial midday.\\r\\n\\r\\nFejjuan, the Galla slave, halted in his tracks, stopping those behind\\r\\nhim by the silent mandate of an upraised hand. Directly before him,\\r\\nseen dimly between the boles and through the foliage, swayed the giant\\r\\nbulk of el-fil. Fejjuan motioned to Fahd, who moved stealthily to the\\r\\nside of the black. The Galla slave pointed through the foliage toward a\\r\\npatch of gray hide. Fahd raised el-Lazzary, his ancient matchlock, to\\r\\nhis shoulder. There was a flash of flame, a burst of smoke, a roar and\\r\\nel-fil, unhit, was bolting through the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tantor surged forward at the sound of the report Tarzan started to\\r\\nspring to an upright position, and at the same instant the pachyderm\\r\\npassed beneath a low hanging limb which struck the ape-man\\'s head,\\r\\nsweeping him to the ground, where he lay stunned and unconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, Tantor thought only of escape as he ran north through the\\r\\nforest, leaving in his wake felled trees, trampled or uptorn bushes.\\r\\nPerhaps he did not know that his friend lay helpless and injured, at\\r\\nthe mercy of the common enemy, man. Tantor never thought of Tarzan\\r\\nas one of the Tarmangani, for the white man was synonymous with\\r\\ndiscomfort, pain, annoyance, whereas Tarzan of the Apes meant to him\\r\\nrestful companionship, peace, happiness. Of all the jungle beasts,\\r\\nexcept his own kind, he fraternized with Tarzan only.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah! Thou missed,\" exclaimed Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gluck!\" ejaculated Fahd. \"Sheytan guided the bullet. But let us\\r\\nsee--perhaps el-fil is hit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, thou missed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men pushed forward, followed by their fellows, looking for the\\r\\nhoped-for carmine spoor. Fahd suddenly stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah! What have we here?\" he cried. \"I fired at el-fil and killed a\\r\\nNasrany.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others crowded about. \"It is indeed a Christian dog, and naked,\\r\\ntoo,\" said Motlog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or some wild man of the forest,\" suggested another. \"Where didst thy\\r\\nbullet strike him, Fahd?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stooped and rolled Tarzan over. \"There is no mark of bullet upon\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he dead? Perhaps he, too, hunted el-fil and was slain by the great\\r\\nbeast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is not dead,\" announced Fejjuan, who had kneeled and placed an ear\\r\\nabove the ape-man\\'s heart. \"He lives and from the mark upon his head\\r\\nI think but temporarily out of his wits from a blow. See, he lies in\\r\\nthe path that el-fil made when he ran away--he was struck down in the\\r\\nbrute\\'s flight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will finish him,\" said Fahd, drawing his khusa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, no! Put back thy knife, Fahd,\" said Motlog. \"Let the sheykh\\r\\nsay if he shall be killed. Thou art always too eager for blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is but a Nasrany,\" insisted Fahd. \"Think thou to carry him back to\\r\\nthe menzil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He moves,\" said Fejjuan. \"Presently he will be able to walk there\\r\\nwithout help. But perhaps he will not come with us, and look, he hath\\r\\nthe size and muscles of a giant. Wellah! What a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bind him,\" commanded Fahd. So with thongs of camel hide they made the\\r\\nape-man\\'s two wrists secure together across his belly, nor was the\\r\\nwork completed any too soon. They had scarce done when Tarzan opened\\r\\nhis eyes and looked them slowly over. He shook his head, like some\\r\\ngreat lion, and presently his senses cleared. He recognized the \\'Aarab\\r\\ninstantly for what they were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why are my wrists bound?\" he asked them in their own tongue. \"Remove\\r\\nthe thongs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd laughed. \"Thinkest thou, Nasrany, that thou art some great sheykh\\r\\nthat thou canst order about the Beduw as they were dogs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan,\" replied the ape-man, as one might say, \"I am the sheykh\\r\\nof sheykhs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan!\" exclaimed Motlog. He drew Fahd aside. \"Of all men,\" he said,\\r\\nlowering his voice, \"that it should be our ill fortune to offend this\\r\\none! In every village that we have entered in the past two weeks we\\r\\nhave heard his name. \\'Wait,\\' they have said, \\'until Tarzan, Lord of\\r\\nthe Jungle, returns. He will slay you when he learns that you have\\r\\ntaken slaves in his country\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I drew my khusa thou shouldst not have stopped my hand, Motlog,\"\\r\\ncomplained Fahd; \"but it is not too late yet.\" He placed his hand upon\\r\\nthe hilt of his knife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, nay!\" cried Motlog. \"We have taken slaves in this country.\\r\\nThey are with us now and some of them will escape. Suppose they carry\\r\\nword to the fendy of this great sheykh that we have slain him? Not one\\r\\nof us will live to return to Beled el-Guad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us then take him before Ibn Jad that the responsibility may be\\r\\nhis,\" said Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, you speak wisely,\" replied Motlog. \"What the sheykh doeth with\\r\\nthis man is the sheykh\\'s business. Come!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they returned to where Tarzan stood he eyed them questioningly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you decided to do with me?\" he demanded. \"If you are wise\\r\\nyou will cut these bonds and lead me to your sheykh. I wish a word with\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are only poor men,\" said Motlog. \"It is not for us to say what\\r\\nshall be done, and so we shall take you to our sheykh who will decide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sheik Ibn Jad of the fendy el-Guad squatted in the open men\\'s\\r\\ncompartment of his beyt es-sh\\'ar, and beside him in the mukaad of his\\r\\nhouse of hair sat Tollog, his brother, and a young Beduin, Zeyd, who,\\r\\ndoubtless, found less attraction in the company of the shiek than in\\r\\nthe proximity of the sheik\\'s hareem whose quarters were separated from\\r\\nthe mukaad only by a breast high curtain suspended between the waist\\r\\npoles of the beyt, affording thus an occasional glimpse of Ateja, the\\r\\ndaughter of Ibn Jad. That it also afforded an occasional glimpse of\\r\\nHirfa, his wife, raised not the temperature of Zeyd an iota.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the men talked the two women were busy within their apartment at\\r\\ntheir housewifely duties. In a great brazen jidda Hirfa was placing\\r\\nmutton to be boiled for the next meal while Ateja fashioned sandals\\r\\nfrom an old bag of camel leather impregnated with the juice of the\\r\\ndates that it had borne upon many a rahla, and meanwhile they missed\\r\\nnaught of the conversation that passed in the mukaad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have come a long way without mishap from our own beled,\" Ibn Jad\\r\\nwas remarking, \"and the way has been longer because I wished not to\\r\\npass through el-Habash lest we be set upon or followed by the people of\\r\\nthat country. Now may we turn north again and enter el-Habash close to\\r\\nthe spot where the magician foretold we should find the treasure city\\r\\nof Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thinkest thou to find this fabled city easily, once we are within\\r\\nthe boundaries of el-Habash?\" asked Tollog, his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, yes. It is known to the people of this far south Habash.\\r\\nFejjuan, himself an Habashy, though he has never been there, heard of\\r\\nit as a boy. We shall take prisoners among them and, by the grace of\\r\\nUllah, we shall find the means to loose their tongues and have the\\r\\ntruth from them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, I hope it does not prove like the treasure that lies upon\\r\\nthe great rock el-Howwara in the plain of Medain Salih,\" said Zeyd. \"An\\r\\nafrit guards it where it lays sealed in a stone tower and they say that\\r\\nshould it be removed disaster would befall man-kind; for men would turn\\r\\nupon their friends, and even upon their brothers, the sons of their\\r\\nfathers and mothers, and the kings of the world would give battle, one\\r\\nagainst another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yea,\" testified Tollog, \"I had it from one of the fendy Hazim that\\r\\na wise Moghreby came by there in his travels and consulting the\\r\\ncabalistic signs in his book of magic discovered that indeed the\\r\\ntreasure lay there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But none dared take it up,\" said Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah!\" exclaimed Ibn Jad. \"There be no afrit guarding the treasures\\r\\nof Nimmr. Naught but flesh and blood Habash that may be laid low with\\r\\nball and powder. The treasure is ours for the taking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ullah grant that it may be as easily found as the treasure of\\r\\nGeryeh,\" said Zeyd, \"which lays a journey north of Tebuk in the ancient\\r\\nruins of a walled city. There, each Friday, the pieces of money roll\\r\\nout of the ground and run about over the desert until sunset.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once we are come to Nimmr there will be no difficulty finding the\\r\\ntreasure,\" Ibn Jad assured them. \"The difficulty will lie in getting\\r\\nout of el-Habash with the treasure and the woman; and if she is as\\r\\nbeautiful as the sahar said, the men of Nimmr may protect her even more\\r\\nsavagely than they would the treasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Often do magicians lie,\" said Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who comes?\" exclaimed Ibn Jad, looking toward the jungle that hemmed\\r\\nthe menzil upon all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah! it is Fahd and Motlog returning from the hunt,\" said Tollog.\\r\\n\"Ullah grant that they bring ivory and meat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They return too soon,\" said Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they do not come empty handed,\" and Ibn Jad pointed toward the\\r\\nnaked giant that accompanied the returning hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group surrounding Tarzan approached the sheik\\'s beyt and halted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrapped in his soiled calico thob, his head kerchief drawn across the\\r\\nlower part of his face, Ibn Jad exposed but two villainous eyes to\\r\\nthe intent scrutiny of the ape-man which simultaneously included the\\r\\npock-marked, shifty-eyed visage of Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother, and\\r\\nthe not ill-favored countenance of the youthful Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is sheykh here?\" demanded Tarzan in tones of authority that belied\\r\\nthe camel leather thongs about his wrists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad permitted his thorrib to fall from before his face. \"Wellah, I\\r\\nam sheykh,\" he said, \"and by what name art thou known, Nasrany?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They call me Tarzan of the Apes, Moslem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan of the Apes,\" mused Ibn Jad. \"I have heard the name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Doubtless. It is not unknown to \\'Aarab slave raiders. Why, then, came\\r\\nyou to my country, knowing I do not permit my people to be taken into\\r\\nslavery?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do not come for slaves,\" Ibn Jad assured him. \"We do but trade in\\r\\npeace for ivory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou liest in thy beard, Moslem,\" returned Tarzan, quietly. \"I\\r\\nrecognize both Manyuema and Galla slaves in thy menzil, and I know that\\r\\nthey are not here of their own choosing. Then, too, was I not present\\r\\nwhen your henchmen fired a shot at el-fil? Is that peaceful trading for\\r\\nivory? No! it is poaching, and that Tarzan of the Apes does not permit\\r\\nin his country. You are raiders and poachers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah! we are honest men,\" cried Ibn Jad. \"Fahd and Motlog did but\\r\\nhunt for meat. If they shot el-fil it must be that they mistook him for\\r\\nanother beast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough!\" cried Tarzan. \"Remove the thongs that bind me and prepare\\r\\nto return north from whence thou came. Thou shalt have an escort and\\r\\nbearers to the Soudan. These will I arrange for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have come a long way and wish only to trade in peace,\" insisted Ibn\\r\\nJad. \"We shall pay our bearers for their labor and take no slaves, nor\\r\\nshall we again fire upon el-fil. Let us go our way and when we return\\r\\nwe will pay you well for permission to pass through your country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan shook his head. \"No! you shall go at once. Come, cut these\\r\\nbonds!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad\\'s eyes narrowed. \"We have offered thee peace and profits,\\r\\nNasrany,\" he said, \"but if thou wouldst have war let it be war. Thou\\r\\nart in our power and remember that dead enemies are harmless. Think it\\r\\nover.\" And to Fahd: \"Take him away and bind his feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be careful, Moslem,\" warned Tarzan, \"the arms of the ape-man are\\r\\nlong--they may reach out even in death and their fingers encircle your\\r\\nthroat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shalt have until dark to decide, Nasrany, and thou mayest know\\r\\nthat Ibn Jad will not turn back until he hath that for which he came.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took Tarzan then and at a distance from the beyt of Ibn Jad they\\r\\npushed him into a small hejra; but once within this tent it required\\r\\nthree men to throw him to the ground and bind his ankles, even though\\r\\nhis wrists were already bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beyt of the sheik the Beduins sipped their coffee, sickish with\\r\\nclove, cinnamon and other spice, the while they discussed the ill\\r\\nfortune that had befallen them; for, regardless of his bravado, Ibn Jad\\r\\nknew full well that only speed and most propitious circumstances could\\r\\nnow place the seal of success upon his venture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for Motlog,\" said Fahd, \"we would now have no cause for worry\\r\\nconcerning the Nasrany, for I had my knife ready to slit the dog\\'s\\r\\nthroat when Motlog interfered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And had word of his slaying spread broadcast over his country before\\r\\nanother sunset and all his people at our heels,\" countered Motlog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah,\" said Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother. \"I wish Fahd had done the\\r\\nthing he wished. After all how much better off are we if we permit the\\r\\nNasrany to live? Should we free him we know that he will gather his\\r\\npeople and drive us from the country. If we keep him prisoner and an\\r\\nescaped slave carries word of it to his people will they not be upon us\\r\\neven more surely than as though we had slain him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tollog, thou speakest words of wisdom,\" said Ibn Jad, nodding\\r\\nappreciatively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But wait,\" said Tollog, \"I have within me, unspoken, words of even\\r\\ngreater worth.\" He leaned forward motioning the others closer and\\r\\nlowered his voice. \"Should this one whom they call Tarzan escape during\\r\\nthe night, or should we set him free, there would be no bad word for\\r\\nan escaped slave to bear to his people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah!\" exclaimed Fahd disgustedly. \"There would be no need for an\\r\\nescaped slave to bring word to his people--the Nasrany himself would do\\r\\nthat and lead them upon us in person. Bah! the brains of Tollog are as\\r\\ncamel\\'s dung.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou hast not heard all that I would say, brother,\" continued Tollog,\\r\\nignoring Fahd. \"It would only _seem_ to the slaves that this man had\\r\\nescaped, for in the morning he would be gone and we would make great\\r\\nlamentation over the matter, or we would say: \\'Wellah, it is true that\\r\\nIbn Jad made peace with the stranger, who departed into the jungle,\\r\\nblessing him\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not follow thee, brother,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Nasrany lies bound in yonder hejra. The night will be dark. A slim\\r\\nknife between his ribs were enough. There be faithful Habash among\\r\\nus who will do our bidding, nor speak of the matter after. They can\\r\\nprepare a trench from the bottom of which a dead Tarzan may not reach\\r\\nout to harm us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, it is plain that thou art of sheykhly blood, Tollog,\"\\r\\nexclaimed Ibn Jad. \"The wisdom of thy words proclaims it. Thou shalt\\r\\nattend to the whole matter. Then will it be done secretly and well. The\\r\\nblessings of Ullah be upon thee!\" and Ibn Jad arose and entered the\\r\\nquarters of his hareem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n                        _Comrades of the Wild_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDarkness fell upon the menzil of Ibn Jad the sheik. Beneath the small\\r\\nflitting tent where his captors had left him, Tarzan still struggled\\r\\nwith the bonds that secured his wrists, but the tough camel leather\\r\\nwithstood even the might of his giant thews. At times he lay listening\\r\\nto the night noises of the jungle, many of them noises that no other\\r\\nhuman ear could have heard, and always he interpreted each correctly.\\r\\nHe knew when Numa passed and Sheeta the leopard; and then from afar and\\r\\nso faintly that it was but the shadow of a whisper, there came down the\\r\\nwind the trumpeting of a bull elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the beyt of Ibn Jad Ateja, the sheik\\'s daughter, loitered, and\\r\\nwith her was Zeyd. They stood very close to one another and the man\\r\\nheld the maiden\\'s hands in his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me, Ateja,\" he said, \"that you love no other than Zeyd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many times must I tell you that?\" whispered the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you do not love Fahd?\" insisted the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, no!\" she ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet your father gives the impression that one day you will be Fahd\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father wishes me to be of the hareem of Fahd, but I mistrust the\\r\\nman, and I could not belong to one whom I neither loved nor trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I, too, mistrust Fahd,\" said Zeyd. \"Listen Ateja! I doubt his loyalty\\r\\nto thy father, and not his alone, but another whose name I durst not\\r\\neven whisper. Upon occasions I have seen them muttering together when\\r\\nthey thought that there were no others about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl nodded her head. \"I know. It is not necessary even to whisper\\r\\nthe name to me--and I hate him even as I hate Fahd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he is of thine own kin,\" the youth reminded her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What of that? Is he not also my father\\'s brother? If that bond does\\r\\nnot hold him loyal to Ibn Jad, who hath treated him well, why should I\\r\\npretend loyalty for him? Nay, I think him a traitor to my father, but\\r\\nIbn Jad seems blind to the fact. We are a long way from our own country\\r\\nand if aught should befall the sheykh, Tollog, being next of blood,\\r\\nwould assume the sheykhly duties and honors. I think he hath won Fahd\\'s\\r\\nsupport by a promise to further his suit for me with Ibn Jad, for I\\r\\nhave noticed that Tollog exerts himself to praise Fahd in the hearing\\r\\nof my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And perhaps a division of the spoils of the ghrazzu upon the treasure\\r\\ncity,\" suggested Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not unlikely,\" replied the girl, \"and--Ullah! what was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beduins seated about the coffee fire leaped to their feet. The\\r\\nblack slaves, startled, peered out into the darkness from their rude\\r\\nshelters. Muskets were seized. Silence fell again upon the tense,\\r\\nlistening menzil. The weird, uncanny cry that had unnerved them was not\\r\\nrepeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah!\" ejaculated Ibn Jad. \"It came from the midst of the menzil,\\r\\nand it was the voice of a beast, where there are only men and a few\\r\\ndomestic animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could it have been----?\" The speaker stopped as though fearful that\\r\\nthe thing he would suggest might indeed be true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he is a man and that was the voice of a beast,\" insisted Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\"It could not have been he.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he is a Nasrany,\" reminded Fahd. \"Perhaps he has league with\\r\\nSheytan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the sound came from the direction where he lies bound in a hejra,\"\\r\\nobserved another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come!\" said Ibn Jad. \"Let us investigate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith muskets ready the \\'Aarab, lighting the way with paper lanterns,\\r\\napproached the hejra where Tarzan lay. Fearfully the foremost looked\\r\\nwithin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is here,\" he reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan, who was sitting in the center of the tent, surveyed the \\'Aarab\\r\\nsomewhat contemptuously, Ibn Jad pressed forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You heard a cry?\" he demanded of the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I heard it. Camest thou, Sheykh Ibn Jad, to disturb my rest upon\\r\\nso trivial an errand, or camest thou to release me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What manner of cry was it? What did it signify?\" asked Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes smiled grimly. \"It was but the call of a beast to\\r\\none of his kind,\" he replied. \"Does the noble Beduwy tremble thus\\r\\nalways when he hears the voices of the jungle people?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gluck!\" growled Ibn Jad, \"the Beduw fear naught. We thought the sound\\r\\ncame from this hejra and we hastened hither believing some jungle beast\\r\\nhad crept within the menzil and attacked thee. Tomorrow it is the\\r\\nthought of Ibn Jad to release thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not tonight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My people fear thee. They would that when you are released you depart\\r\\nhence immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall. I have no desire to remain in thy lice infested menzil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We could not send thee alone into the jungle at night where el-adrea\\r\\nis abroad hunting,\" protested the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes smiled again, one of his rare smiles. \"Tarzan is\\r\\nmore secure in his teeming jungle than are the Beduwy in their desert,\"\\r\\nhe replied. \"The jungle night has no terrors for Tarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tomorrow,\" snapped the sheik and then, motioning to his followers, he\\r\\ndeparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan watched their paper lanterns bobbing across the camp to the\\r\\nsheik\\'s beyt and then he stretched himself at full length and pressed\\r\\nan ear to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the inhabitants of the \\'Aarab menzil heard the cry of the beast\\r\\nshatter the quiet of the new night it aroused within their breasts a\\r\\ncertain vague unrest, but otherwise it was meaningless to them. Yet\\r\\nthere was one far off in the jungle who caught the call faintly and\\r\\nunderstood--a huge beast, the great, gray dreadnaught of the jungle,\\r\\nTantor the elephant. Again he raised his trunk aloft and trumpeted\\r\\nloudly. His little eyes gleamed redly wicked as, a moment later, he\\r\\nswung off through the forest at a rapid trot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly silence fell upon the menzil of Sheik Ibn Jad as the \\'Aarab and\\r\\ntheir slaves sought their sleeping mats. Only the sheik and his brother\\r\\nsat smoking in the sheik\\'s beyt--smoking and whispering in low tones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not let the slaves see you slay the Nasrany, Tollog,\" cautioned Ibn\\r\\nJad. \"Attend to that yourself first in secrecy and in silence, then\\r\\nquietly arouse two of the slaves. Fejjuan would be as good as another,\\r\\nas he has been among us since childhood and is loyal. He will do well\\r\\nfor one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Abbas is loyal, too, and strong,\" suggested Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yea, let him be the second,\" agreed Ibn Jad. \"But it is well that they\\r\\ndo not know how the Nasrany came to die. Tell them that you heard a\\r\\nnoise in the direction of his hejra and that when you had come to learn\\r\\nthe nature of it you found him thus dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may trust to my discretion, brother,\" Tollog assured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And warn them to secrecy,\" continued the sheik. \"No man but we four\\r\\nmust ever know of the death of the Nasrany, nor of his place of burial.\\r\\nIn the morning we shall tell the others that he escaped during the\\r\\nnight. Leave his cut bonds within the hejra as proof. You understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, fully.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good! Now go. The people sleep.\" The sheik rose and Tollog, also.\\r\\nThe former entered the apartment of his hareem and the latter moved\\r\\nsilently through the darkness of the night in the direction of the\\r\\nhejra where his victim lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the jungle came Tantor the elephant and from his path fled\\r\\ngentle beasts and fierce. Even Numa the lion slunk growling to one side\\r\\nas the mighty pachyderm passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the darkness of the hejra crept Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother; but\\r\\nTarzan, lying with an ear to the ground, had heard him approaching from\\r\\nthe moment that he had left the beyt of Ibn Jad. Tarzan heard other\\r\\nsounds as well and, as he interpreted these others, he interpreted the\\r\\nstealthy approach of Tollog and was convinced when the footsteps turned\\r\\ninto the tent where he lay--convinced of the purpose of his visitor.\\r\\nFor what purpose but the taking of his life would a Beduin visit Tarzan\\r\\nat this hour of the night?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tollog, groping in the dark, entered the tent Tarzan sat erect and\\r\\nagain there smote upon the ears of the Beduin the horrid cry that had\\r\\ndisturbed the menzil earlier in the evening, but this time it arose in\\r\\nthe very hejra in which Tollog stood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beduin halted, aghast. \"Ullah!\" he cried, stepping back. \"What\\r\\nbeast is there? Nasrany! Art thou being attacked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers in the camp were awakened, but none ventured forth to\\r\\ninvestigate. Tarzan smiled and remained silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nasrany!\" repeated Tollog, but there was no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nCautiously, his knife ready in his hand, the Beduin backed from the\\r\\nhejra. He listened but heard no sound from within. Running quickly to\\r\\nhis own beyt he made a light in a paper lantern and hastened back to\\r\\nthe hejra, and this time he carried his musket and it was at full cock.\\r\\nPeering within, the lantern held above his head, Tollog saw the ape-man\\r\\nsitting upon the ground looking at him. There was no wild beast! Then\\r\\nthe Beduin understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah! It wast thou, Nasrany, who made the fearful cries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beduwy, thou comest to kill the Nasrany, eh?\" demanded Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the jungle came the roar of a lion and the trumpeting of a bull\\r\\nelephant, but the boma was high and sharp with thorns and there were\\r\\nguards and beast fire, so Tollog gave no thought to these familiar\\r\\nnoises of the night. He did not answer Tarzan\\'s question but laid aside\\r\\nhis musket and drew his khusa, which after all was answer enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dim light of the paper lantern Tarzan watched these\\r\\npreparations. He saw the cruel expression upon the malevolent face. He\\r\\nsaw the man approaching slowly, the knife ready in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was almost upon him now, his eyes glittering in the faint\\r\\nlight. To the ears of the ape-man came the sound of a commotion at the\\r\\nfar edge of the menzil, followed by an Arab oath. Then Tollog launched\\r\\na blow at Tarzan\\'s breast. The prisoner swung his bound wrists upward\\r\\nand struck the Beduin\\'s knife arm away, and simultaneously he struggled\\r\\nto his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an oath, Tollog struck again, and again Tarzan fended the blow,\\r\\nand this time he followed swiftly with a mighty sweep of his arms that\\r\\nstruck the Beduin upon the side of the head and sent him sprawling\\r\\nacross the hejra; but Tollog was instantly up and at him again, this\\r\\ntime with the ferocity of a maddened bull, yet at the same time with\\r\\nfar greater cunning, for instead of attempting a direct frontal attack\\r\\nTollog leaped quickly around Tarzan to strike him from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his effort to turn upon his knees that he might face his antagonist\\r\\nthe ape-man lost his balance, his feet being bound together, and fell\\r\\nprone at Tollog\\'s mercy. A vicious smile bared the yellow teeth of the\\r\\nBeduin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Die, Nasrany!\" he cried, and then: \"Billah! What was that?\" as, of a\\r\\nsudden, the entire tent was snatched from above his head and hurled off\\r\\ninto the night. He turned quickly and a shriek of terror burst from his\\r\\nlips as he saw, red-eyed and angry, the giant form of el-fil towering\\r\\nabove him; and in that very instant a supple trunk encircled his body\\r\\nand Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother, was raised high aloft and hurled off\\r\\ninto the darkness as the tent had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant Tantor stood looking about, angrily, defiantly, then he\\r\\nreached down and lifted Tarzan from the ground, raised him high above\\r\\nhis head, wheeled about and trotted rapidly across the menzil toward\\r\\nthe jungle. A frightened sentry fired once and fled. The other sentry\\r\\nlay crushed and dead where Tantor had hurled him when he entered the\\r\\ncamp. An instant later Tarzan and Tantor were swallowed by the jungle\\r\\nand the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe menzil of Sheik Ibn Jad was in an uproar. Armed men hastened\\r\\nhither and thither seeking the cause of the disturbance, looking for\\r\\nan attacking enemy. Some came to the spot where had stood the hejra\\r\\nwhere the Nasrany had been confined, but hejra and Nasrany both\\r\\nhad disappeared. Nearby, the beyt of one of Ibn Jad\\'s cronies lay\\r\\nflattened. Beneath it were screaming women and a cursing man. On top of\\r\\nit was Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother, his mouth filled with vile Beduin\\r\\ninvective, whereas it should have contained only praises of Allah\\r\\nand thanksgiving, for Tollog was indeed a most fortunate man. Had he\\r\\nalighted elsewhere than upon the top of a sturdily pegged beyt he had\\r\\ndoubtless been killed or badly injured when Tantor hurled him thus\\r\\nrudely aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad, searching for information, arrived just as Tollog was\\r\\nextricating himself from the folds of the tent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah!\" cried the sheik. \"What has come to pass? What, O brother, art\\r\\nthou doing upon the beyt of Abd el-Aziz?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA slave came running to the sheik. \"The Nasrany is gone and he hath\\r\\ntaken the hejra with him,\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad turned to Tollog. \"Canst thou not explain, brother?\" he\\r\\ndemanded. \"Is the Nasrany truly departed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Nasrany is indeed gone,\" replied Tollog. \"He is in league with\\r\\nSheytan, who came in the guise of el-fil and carried the Nasrany into\\r\\nthe jungle, after throwing me upon the top of the beyt of Abd el-Aziz\\r\\nwhom I still hear squealing and cursing beneath as though it had been\\r\\nhe who was attacked rather than I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad shook his head. Of course he knew that Tollog was a liar--that\\r\\nhe always had known--yet he could not understand how his brother had\\r\\ncome to be upon the top of the beyt of Abed el-Aziz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did the sentries see?\" demanded the sheik. \"Where were they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were at their post,\" spoke up Motlog. \"I was just there. One of\\r\\nthem is dead, the other fired upon the intruder as it escaped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what said he of it?\" demanded Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, he said that el-fil came and entered the menzil, killing\\r\\nYemeny and rushing to the hejra where the Nasrany lay bound, ripping it\\r\\naside, throwing Tollog high into the air. Then he seized the prisoner\\r\\nand bore him off into the jungle, and as he passed him Hasan fired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And missed,\" guessed Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several moments the sheik stood in thought, then he turned slowly\\r\\ntoward his own beyt. \"Tomorrow, early, is the rahla,\" he said; and the\\r\\nword spread quickly that early upon the morrow they would break camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nFar into the forest Tantor bore Tarzan until they had come to a small\\r\\nclearing well carpeted with grass, and here the elephant deposited his\\r\\nburden gently upon the ground and stood guard above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the morning,\" said Tarzan, \"when Kudu the Sun hunts again through\\r\\nthe heavens and there is light by which to see, we shall discover what\\r\\nmay be done about removing these bonds, Tantor; but for now let us\\r\\nsleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNuma the lion, Dango the hyena, Sheeta the leopard passed near that\\r\\nnight, and the scent of the helpless man-thing was strong in their\\r\\nnostrils, but when they saw who stood guard above Tarzan and heard the\\r\\nmutterings of the big bull, they passed on about their business while\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the coming of dawn all was quickly astir in the menzil of Ibn\\r\\nJad. Scarce was the meagre breakfast eaten ere the beyt of the sheik\\r\\nwas taken down by his women, and at this signal the other houses of\\r\\nhair came tumbling to the ground, and within the hour the \\'Aarab were\\r\\nwinding northward toward el-Habash.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beduins and their women were mounted upon the desert ponies that\\r\\nhad survived the long journey from the north, while the slaves that\\r\\nthey had brought with them from their own country marched afoot at\\r\\nthe front and rear of the column in the capacity of askari, and these\\r\\nwere armed with muskets. Their bearers were the natives that they\\r\\nhad impressed into their service along the way. These carried the\\r\\nimpedimenta of the camp and herded the goats and sheep along the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeyd rode beside Ateja, the daughter of the sheik, and more often were\\r\\nhis eyes upon her profile than upon the trail ahead. Fahd, who rode\\r\\nnear Ibn Jad, cast an occasional angry glance in the direction of the\\r\\ntwo. Tollog, the sheik\\'s brother, saw and grinned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zeyd is a bolder suitor than thou, Fahd,\" he whispered to the young\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has whispered lies into her ears and she will have none of me,\"\\r\\ncomplained Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the sheykh favored thy suit though,\" suggested Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he does not,\" snapped Fahd. \"A word from you might aid. You\\r\\npromised it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, yes, but my brother is an over-indulgent sire,\" explained\\r\\nTollog. \"He doth not mislike you, Fahd, but rather he would have his\\r\\nbint happy, and so leaves the selection of her mate to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there to do, then?\" demanded Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were sheykh, now,\" suggested Tollog, \"but alas I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were sheykh, what then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My niece would go to the man of my own choosing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not sheykh,\" Fahd reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTollog leaned close and whispered in Fahd\\'s ear. \"A suitor as bold as\\r\\nZeyd would find the way to make me sheykh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd made no reply but only rode on in silence, his head bowed and his\\r\\nbrows contracted in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _The Apes of Toyat_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days crawled slowly out of the east and followed one another\\r\\nacross the steaming jungle and over the edge of the world beyond. For\\r\\nthree days the \\'Aarab moved slowly northward toward el-Habash. For\\r\\nthree days Tarzan of the Apes lay in the little clearing, bound and\\r\\nhelpless, while Tantor the elephant stood guard above him. Once each\\r\\nday the great bull brought the ape-man food and water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camel leather thongs held securely and no outside aid appeared\\r\\nto release Tarzan from the ever increasing discomfort and danger of\\r\\nhis predicament. He had called to Manu the monkey to come and gnaw\\r\\nthe strands apart, but Manu, ever irresponsible, had only promised\\r\\nand forgotten. And so the ape-man lay uncomplaining, as is the way of\\r\\nbeasts, patiently waiting for release, knowing that it might come in\\r\\nthe habiliment of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the morning of the fourth day Tantor gave evidences of\\r\\nrestlessness. His brief foragings had exhausted the nearby supply of\\r\\nfood for himself and his charge. He wanted to move on and take Tarzan\\r\\nwith him; but the ape-man was now convinced that to be carried farther\\r\\ninto the elephant country would lessen his chances for succor, for he\\r\\nfelt that the only one of the jungle people who could release him was\\r\\nMangani the great ape. Tarzan knew that already he was practically at\\r\\nthe outer limits of the Mangani country, yet there was a remote chance\\r\\nthat a band of the great anthropoids might pass this way and discover\\r\\nhim, while, should Tantor carry him farther north even this meager\\r\\nlikelihood of release would be lost forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTantor wanted to be gone. He nudged Tarzan with his trunk and rolled\\r\\nhim over. He raised him from the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put me down, Tantor,\" said the ape-man, and the pachyderm obeyed, but\\r\\nhe turned and walked away. Tarzan watched him cross the clearing to the\\r\\ntrees upon the far side. There Tantor hesitated, stopped, turned. He\\r\\nlooked back at Tarzan and trumpeted. He dug up the earth with a great\\r\\ntusk and appeared angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go and feed,\" said Tarzan, \"and then return. Tomorrow the Mangani may\\r\\ncome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTantor trumpeted again and, wheeling about, disappeared in the jungle.\\r\\nFor a long time the ape-man lay listening to the retreating footfalls\\r\\nof his old friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is gone,\" he mused. \"I cannot blame him. Perhaps it is as well.\\r\\nWhat matter whether it be today, tomorrow, or the day after?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning passed. The noonday silence lay upon the jungle. Only the\\r\\ninsects were abroad. They annoyed Tarzan as they did the other jungle\\r\\nbeasts, but to the poison of their stings he was immune through a\\r\\nlifetime of inoculation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there came a great scampering through the trees. Little Manu\\r\\nand his brothers, his sisters and his cousins came trooping madly\\r\\nthrough the middle terrace, squealing, chattering and scolding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Manu!\" called Tarzan. \"What comes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Mangani! The Mangani!\" shrieked the monkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go and fetch them, Manu!\" commanded the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go and call to them from the upper terraces,\" urged Tarzan. \"They\\r\\ncannot reach you there. Tell them that one of their people lies\\r\\nhelpless here. Tell them to come and release me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They cannot reach you in the upper terraces. Go! They will be your\\r\\nfriends then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They cannot climb to the upper terraces,\" said an old monkey. \"I will\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others, halted in their flight, turned and watched the gray-beard\\r\\nas he scampered quickly off amongst the loftiest branches of the great\\r\\ntrees, and Tarzan waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he heard the deep gutturals of his own people, the great\\r\\napes, the Mangani. Perhaps there would be those among them who knew\\r\\nhim. Perhaps, again, the band may have come from afar and have no\\r\\nknowledge of him, though that he doubted. In them, however, was his\\r\\nonly hope. He lay there, listening, waiting. He heard Manu screaming\\r\\nand chattering as he scampered about high above the Mangani, then, of\\r\\na sudden, silence fell upon the jungle. There was only the sound of\\r\\ninsects, buzzing, humming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man lay looking in the direction from which had come the sounds\\r\\nof the approaching anthropoids. He knew what was transpiring behind\\r\\nthat dense wall of foliage. He knew that presently a pair of fierce\\r\\neyes would be examining him, surveying the clearing, searching for an\\r\\nenemy, warily probing for a trick or a trap. He knew that the first\\r\\nsight of him might arouse distrust, fear, rage; for what reason had\\r\\nthey to love or trust the cruel and merciless Tarmangani?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere lay great danger in the possibility that, seeing him, they might\\r\\nquietly withdraw without showing themselves. That, then, would be the\\r\\nend, for there were no others than the Mangani to whom he might look\\r\\nfor rescue. With this in mind he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a friend,\" he called to them. \"The Tarmangani caught me and bound\\r\\nmy wrists and ankles. I cannot move. I cannot defend myself. I cannot\\r\\nget food nor water. Come and remove my bonds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom just behind the screen of foliage a voice replied. \"You are a\\r\\nTarmangani.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" replied the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" screamed Manu, \"he is Tarzan of the Apes. The Tarmangani and the\\r\\nGomangani bound him and Tantor brought him here. Four times has Kudu\\r\\nhunted across the sky while Tarzan of the Apes lay bound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know Tarzan,\" said another voice from behind the foliage and\\r\\npresently the leaves parted and a huge, shaggy ape lumbered into the\\r\\nclearing. Swinging along with knuckles to the ground the brute came\\r\\nclose to Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"M\\'walat!\" exclaimed the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Tarzan of the Apes,\" said the great ape, but the others did not\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" they demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whose band is this?\" asked Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toyat is king,\" replied M\\'walat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then do not tell them it is really I,\" whispered Tarzan, \"until\\r\\nyou have cut these bonds. Toyat hates me. He will kill me if I am\\r\\ndefenseless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" agreed M\\'walat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said Tarzan, raising his bound wrists. \"Bite these bonds in\\r\\ntwo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are Tarzan of the Apes, the friend of M\\'walat. M\\'walat will do as\\r\\nyou ask,\" replied the ape.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, in the meager language of the apes, their conversation did\\r\\nnot sound at all like a conversation between men, but was rather a\\r\\nmixture of growls and grunts and gestures which, however, served every\\r\\npurpose that could have been served by the most formal and correct of\\r\\ncivilized speech since it carried its messages clearly to the minds of\\r\\nboth the Mangani and the Tarmangani, the Great Ape and the Great White\\r\\nApe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the other members of the band pressed forward into the clearing,\\r\\nseeing that M\\'walat was not harmed, the latter stooped and with\\r\\npowerful teeth severed the camel leather thongs that secured the wrists\\r\\nof the ape-man, and similarly he freed his ankles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tarzan came to his feet the balance of the fierce and shaggy band\\r\\nswung into the clearing. In the lead was Toyat, king ape, and at his\\r\\nheels eight more full grown males with perhaps six or seven females\\r\\nand a number of young. The young and the shes hung back, but the bulls\\r\\npressed forward to where Tarzan stood with M\\'walat at his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king ape growled menacingly. \"Tarmangani!\" he cried. Wheeling in\\r\\na circle he leaped into the air and came down on all fours; he struck\\r\\nthe ground savagely with his clenched fists; he growled and foamed, and\\r\\nleaped again and again. Toyat was working himself to a pitch of rage\\r\\nthat would nerve him to attack the Tarmangani, and by these maneuvers\\r\\nhe hoped also to arouse the savage fighting spirit of his fellows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Tarzan of the Apes, friend of the Mangani,\" said M\\'walat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a Tarmangani, enemy of the Mangani,\" cried Toyat. \"They come\\r\\nwith great thunder sticks and kill us. They make our shes and our balus\\r\\ndead with a loud noise. Kill the Tarmangani.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Tarzan of the Apes,\" growled Gayat. \"When I was a little balu he\\r\\nsaved me from Numa. Tarzan of the Apes is the friend of the Mangani.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kill the Tarmangani!\" shrieked Toyat, leaping high into the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the other bulls were now circling and leaping into the air\\r\\nas Gayat placed himself at Tarzan\\'s side. The ape-man knew them well.\\r\\nHe knew that sooner or later one of them would have excited himself to\\r\\nsuch a pitch of maniacal frenzy that he would leap suddenly upon him.\\r\\nM\\'walat and Gayat would attack in his defense; several more bulls would\\r\\nlaunch themselves into the battle and there would ensue a free for all\\r\\nfight from which not all of them would emerge alive, and none without\\r\\nmore or less serious injuries; but Tarzan of the Apes did not wish to\\r\\nbattle with his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop!\" he commanded raising his opened palm to attract attention. \"I\\r\\nam Tarzan of the Apes, mighty hunter, mighty fighter; long did I range\\r\\nwith the tribe of Kerchak; when Kerchak died I became king ape; many of\\r\\nyou know me; all know that I am first a Mangani; that I am friend to\\r\\nall Mangani. Toyat would have you kill me because Toyat hates Tarzan\\r\\nof the Apes. He hates him not because he is a Tarmangani but because\\r\\nTarzan once kept Toyat from becoming king. That was many rains ago when\\r\\nsome of you were still balus. If Toyat has been a good king Tarzan is\\r\\nglad, but now he is not acting like a good king for he is trying to\\r\\nturn you against your best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, Zutho!\" he exclaimed, suddenly pointing a finger at a huge bull.\\r\\n\"You leap and growl and foam at the mouth. You would sink your fangs\\r\\ninto the flesh of Tarzan. Have you forgotten, Zutho, the time that you\\r\\nwere sick and the other members of the tribe left you to die? Have you\\r\\nforgotten who brought you food and water? Have you forgotten who it was\\r\\nthat kept Sabor the lioness and Sheeta the panther and Dango the hyena\\r\\nfrom you during those long nights?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tarzan spoke, his tone one of quiet authority, the apes gradually\\r\\npaused to listen to his words. It was a long speech for the jungle\\r\\nfolk. The great apes nor the little monkeys long concentrated upon one\\r\\nidea. Already, before he had finished, one of the bulls was overturning\\r\\na rotted log in search of succulent insects. Zutho was wrinkling his\\r\\nbrows in unaccustomed recollection. Presently he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zutho remembers,\" he said. \"He is the friend of Tarzan,\" and ranged\\r\\nhimself beside M\\'walat. With this the other bulls, except Toyat,\\r\\nappeared to lose interest in the proceedings and either wandered off in\\r\\nsearch of food or squatted down in the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat still fumed, but as he saw his cause deserted he prosecuted his\\r\\nwar dance at a safer distance from Tarzan and his defenders, and it was\\r\\nnot long before he, too, was attracted by the more profitable business\\r\\nof bug hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Tarzan ranged again with the great apes. And as he loafed lazily\\r\\nthrough the forest with the shaggy brutes he thought of his foster\\r\\nmother, Kala, the great she-ape, the only mother he had ever known; he\\r\\nrecalled with a thrill of pride her savage defense of him against all\\r\\ntheir natural enemies of the jungle and against the hate and jealousy\\r\\nof old Tublat, her mate, and against the enmity of Kerchak, the\\r\\nterrible old king ape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it had been but yesterday since he had seen him, Tarzan\\'s memory\\r\\nprojected again upon the screen of recollection the huge bulk and\\r\\nthe ferocious features of old Kerchak. What a magnificent beast he\\r\\nhad been! To the childish mind of the ape-boy Kerchak had been the\\r\\npersonification of savage ferocity and authority, and even today he\\r\\nrecalled him with almost a sensation of awe. That he had overthrown\\r\\nand slain this gigantic ruler still seemed to Tarzan almost incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fought again his battles with Terkoz and with Bolgani the gorilla.\\r\\nHe thought of Teeka, whom he had loved, and of Thaka and Tana, and\\r\\nof the little black boy, Tibo, whom he had endeavored to adopt; and\\r\\nso he dreamed through lazy daylight hours while Ibn Jad crept slowly\\r\\nnorthward toward the leopard city of Nimmr and in another part of the\\r\\njungle events were transpiring that were to entangle Tarzan in the\\r\\nmeshes of a great adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n                         _Bolgani the Gorilla_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA black porter caught his foot in an entangling creeper and stumbled,\\r\\nthrowing his load to the ground. Of such trivialities are crises born.\\r\\nThis one altered the entire life of James Hunter Blake, young, rich,\\r\\nAmerican, hunting big game for the first time in Africa with his friend\\r\\nWilbur Stimbol who, having spent three weeks in the jungle two years\\r\\nbefore, was naturally the leader of the expedition and an infallible\\r\\nauthority on all matters pertaining to big game, African jungle,\\r\\nsafari, food, weather and negroes. The further fact that Stimbol was\\r\\ntwenty-five years Blake\\'s senior naturally but augmented his claims to\\r\\nomniscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese factors did not in themselves constitute the basis for the\\r\\ngrowing differences between the two men, for Blake was a phlegmatically\\r\\ninclined young man of twenty-five who was rather amused at Stimbol\\'s\\r\\negotism than otherwise. The first rift had occurred at railhead when,\\r\\nthrough Stimbol\\'s domineering manner and ill temper, the entire purpose\\r\\nof the expedition had been abandoned by necessity, and what was to\\r\\nhave been a quasi scientific motion picture camera study of wild\\r\\nAfrican life had resolved itself into an ordinary big game hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt railhead, while preparations were going on to secure equipment and\\r\\na safari, Stimbol had so offended and insulted the cameraman that he\\r\\nhad left them flat and returned to the coast. Blake was disappointed,\\r\\nbut he made up his mind to go on through and get what pictures he could\\r\\nwith a still camera. He was not a man who enjoyed killing for the mere\\r\\nsport of taking life, and as originally planned there was to have been\\r\\nno shooting of game except for food and half a dozen trophies that\\r\\nStimbol particularly wished to add to his collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had since been one or two altercations relative to Stimbol\\'s\\r\\ntreatment of the black porters, but these matters, Blake was hopeful,\\r\\nhad been ironed out and Stimbol had promised to leave the handling of\\r\\nthe safari to Blake and refrain from any further abuse of the men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had come into the interior even farther than they had planned,\\r\\nhad had the poorest of luck in the matter of game and were about to\\r\\nturn back toward railhead. It seemed now to Blake that after all they\\r\\nwere going to pull through without further difficulty and that he and\\r\\nStimbol would return to America together, to all intent and purpose\\r\\nstill friends; but just then a black porter caught his foot in an\\r\\nentangling creeper and stumbled, throwing his load to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly in front of the porter Stimbol and Blake were walking side by\\r\\nside and, as though guided by a malevolent power, the load crashed into\\r\\nStimbol, hurling him to the ground. Stimbol and the porter scrambled\\r\\nto their feet amidst the laughter of the negroes who had witnessed the\\r\\naccident. The porter was grinning. Stimbol was flushed with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You damned clumsy nigger!\" he cried, and before Blake could interfere\\r\\nor the porter protect himself the angry white man stepped quickly over\\r\\nthe fallen load and struck the black a terrific blow in the face that\\r\\nfelled him; and as he lay there, Stimbol kicked him in the side. But\\r\\nonly once! Before he could repeat the outrage Blake seized him by the\\r\\nshoulder, wheeled him about and struck him precisely as he had struck\\r\\nthe black.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol fell, rolled over on his side and reached for the automatic\\r\\nthat hung at his hip, but quick as he was Blake was quicker. \"Cut\\r\\nthat!\" said Blake, crisply, covering Stimbol with a .45. Stimbol\\'s hand\\r\\ndropped from the grip of his gun. \"Get up!\" ordered Blake, and when the\\r\\nother had risen: \"Now listen to me, Stimbol--this is the end. You and\\r\\nI are through. Tomorrow morning we split the safari and equipment, and\\r\\nwhichever way you go with your half I\\'ll go in the opposite direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake had returned his gun to its holster as he spoke, the black had\\r\\nrisen and was nursing a bloody nose, the other blacks were looking\\r\\non sullenly. Blake motioned to the porter to pick up his load and\\r\\npresently the safari was again on the move--a sullen safari without\\r\\nlaughter or song.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake made camp at the first available ground shortly before noon in\\r\\norder that the division of equipment, food and men could be made during\\r\\nthe afternoon and the two safaris thus be enabled to make an early\\r\\nstart the following morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, sullen, would give no assistance, but, taking a couple of the\\r\\naskari, the armed natives who act as soldiers for the safari, started\\r\\nout from camp to hunt. He had proceeded scarcely a mile along a mould\\r\\npadded game trail which gave forth no sound in answer to their falling\\r\\nfootsteps, when one of the natives in the lead held up his hand in\\r\\nwarning as he halted in his tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol advanced cautiously and the black pointed toward the left,\\r\\nthrough the foliage. Dimly, Stimbol saw a black mass moving slowly away\\r\\nfrom them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gorilla,\" replied the black.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol raised his rifle and fired at the retreating figure. The black\\r\\nwas not surprised that he missed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hell!\" ejaculated the white. \"Come on, get after him! I\\'ve got to have\\r\\nhim. Gad! what a trophy he\\'ll make.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jungle was rather more open than usual and again and again they\\r\\ncame within sight of the retreating gorilla. Each time Stimbol fired\\r\\nand each time he missed. Secretly the blacks were amused and pleased.\\r\\nThey did not like Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance Tarzan of the Apes, hunting with the tribe of Toyat,\\r\\nheard the first shot and immediately took to the trees and was\\r\\nracing in the direction of the sound. He felt sure that the weapon\\r\\nhad not been discharged by the Beduins, for he well knew and could\\r\\ndifferentiate between the reports of their muskets and those made by\\r\\nmodern weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, he thought, there may be among them such a rifle, because such\\r\\nwas not impossible, but more likely it meant white men, and in Tarzan\\'s\\r\\ncountry it was his business to know what strangers were there and why.\\r\\nSeldom they came even now, though once they had never come. It was\\r\\nthose days that Tarzan regretted, for when the white man comes peace\\r\\nand happiness depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nRacing through the trees, swinging from limb to limb, Tarzan of the\\r\\nApes unerringly followed the direction of the sound of the succeeding\\r\\nshots; and as he approached more closely the scene of the pursuit of\\r\\nBolgani the gorilla, he heard the crashing of underbrush and the voices\\r\\nof men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBolgani, fleeing with greater haste than caution, his mind and\\r\\nattention occupied by thoughts of escape from the hated Tarmangani and\\r\\nthe terrifying thunder stick that roared each time the Tarmangani came\\r\\nwithin sight of him, abandoned his accustomed wariness and hurried\\r\\nthrough the jungle forgetful of what few other enemies might beset his\\r\\npath; and so it was that he failed to see Histah the snake draped in\\r\\nsinuous loops along an overhanging branch of a nearby patriarch of the\\r\\nforest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge python, naturally short tempered and irritable, had been\\r\\ndisturbed and annoyed by the crashing sounds of pursuit and escape and\\r\\nthe roaring voice of the rifle. Ordinarily he would have permitted a\\r\\nfull grown bull gorilla to pass unmolested, but in his present state of\\r\\nmind he might have attacked even Tantor himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis beady eyes glaring fixedly, he watched the approach of the shaggy\\r\\nBolgani, and as the gorilla passed beneath the limb to which he clung\\r\\nHistah launched himself upon his prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the great coils, powerful, relentless, silent, encircled Bolgani,\\r\\nhe sought to tear the hideous folds from him. Great is the strength\\r\\nof Bolgani, but even greater is that of Histah the snake. A single\\r\\nhideous, almost human scream burst from the lips of Bolgani with the\\r\\nfirst realization of the disaster that had befallen him, and then he\\r\\nwas on the ground tearing futilely at the steadily tightening bands\\r\\nof living steel that would crush the life from him, crush until his\\r\\nbones gave to the tremendous pressure, until only broken pulp remained\\r\\nwithin a sausage like thing that would slip between the distended jaws\\r\\nof the serpent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was upon this sight that Stimbol and Tarzan came\\r\\nsimultaneously--Stimbol stumbling awkwardly through the underbrush,\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes, demigod of the forest, swinging gracefully through\\r\\nthe foliage of the middle terraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey arrived simultaneously but Tarzan was the only one of the party\\r\\nwhose presence was unsuspected by the others, for, as always, he had\\r\\nmoved silently and with the utmost wariness because of the unknown\\r\\nnature of the conditions he might discover.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he looked down upon the scene below his quick eye and his knowledge\\r\\nof the jungle revealed at a glance the full story of the tragedy that\\r\\nhad overtaken Bolgani, and then he saw Stimbol raise his rifle, intent\\r\\nupon bagging two royal specimens with a single shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the heart of Tarzan was no great love for Bolgani the gorilla. Since\\r\\nchildhood the shaggy, giant man-beast had been the natural foe of the\\r\\nape-man. His first mortal combat had been with Bolgani. For years he\\r\\nhad feared him, or rather avoided him through caution, for of fear\\r\\nTarzan was ignorant; and since he had emerged from childhood he had\\r\\ncontinued to avoid Bolgani for the simple reason that his own people,\\r\\nthe great apes, avoided him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now when he saw the huge brute beset by two of the natural enemies\\r\\nof both the Mangani and the Bolgani, there flared within his breast a\\r\\nsudden loyalty that burned away the personal prejudices of a lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was directly above Stimbol, and with such celerity do the mind and\\r\\nmuscles of the ape-man coordinate that even as the American raised his\\r\\nweapon to his shoulder Tarzan had dropped upon his back, felling him\\r\\nto the earth; and before Stimbol could discover what had happened to\\r\\nhim, long before he could stumble, cursing, to his feet, Tarzan, who\\r\\nhad been unarmed, had snatched the hunter\\'s knife from its scabbard and\\r\\nleaped full upon the writhing, struggling mass of python and gorilla.\\r\\nStimbol came to his feet ready to kill but what he saw before him\\r\\ntemporarily drove the desire for vengeance from his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaked but for a loin cloth, bronzed, black-haired, a giant white man\\r\\nbattled with the dread python; and as Stimbol watched he shuddered as\\r\\nhe became aware that the low, beast-like growls he heard came not alone\\r\\nfrom the savage lips of the gorilla but from the throat of the god-like\\r\\nman-thing that fought for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteel fingers encircled the python just back of its head, while those\\r\\nof the free hand drove Stimbol\\'s hunting knife again and again into the\\r\\ncoiling, writhing body of the serpent. With the projection of a new\\r\\nand more menacing enemy into the battle, Histah was forced partially\\r\\nto release his hold upon Bolgani with, at first, the intention of\\r\\nincluding Tarzan in the same embrace that he might crush them both at\\r\\nonce; but soon he discovered that the hairless man-thing constituted\\r\\na distinct menace to his life that would necessitate his undivided\\r\\nattention, and so he quickly uncoiled from about Bolgani and in a\\r\\nfrenzy of rage and pain that whipped his great length into a lashing\\r\\nfury of destruction he sought to encircle the ape-man; but wheresoever\\r\\nhis coils approached, the keen knife bit deep into tortured flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nBolgani, the spark of life all but crushed from him, lay gasping upon\\r\\nthe ground, unable to come to the aid of his preserver, while Stimbol,\\r\\ngoggle-eyed with awe and terror, kept at a safe distance, momentarily\\r\\nforgetful both of his lust for trophies and his bent for revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus was Tarzan pitted, single-handed, against one of the mightiest of\\r\\nNature\\'s creations in a duel to the death, the result of which seemed\\r\\nto the watching American already a foregone conclusion, for what man\\r\\nborn of woman could hope, unaided, to escape from the embrace of the\\r\\ndeadly coils of a python?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready Histah had encircled the torso and one leg of the ape-man,\\r\\nbut his powers of constriction, lessened by the frightful wounds he\\r\\nhad received, had as yet been unable to crush his adversary into\\r\\nhelplessness, and Tarzan was now concentrating his attention and the\\r\\nheavy blade of the hunting knife upon a single portion of the weakening\\r\\nbody in an attempt to cut Histah in two.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan and serpent were red with blood; and crimson were the grasses and\\r\\nthe brush for yards in all directions as, with a final effort, Histah\\r\\nclosed his giant coils spasmodically about his victim at the instant\\r\\nthat Tarzan with a mighty upward heavy lunge cut through the vertebrae\\r\\nof the great snake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLashing and writhing, the nether portion, headless, flopped aside while\\r\\nthe ape-man, still fighting with what remained, exerting his superhuman\\r\\nstrength to its ultimate utmost, slowly forced the coils from about\\r\\nhis body and cast the dying Histah from him. Then, without a glance at\\r\\nStimbol, he turned to Bolgani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are hurt to death?\" he asked in the language of the great apes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied the gorilla. \"I am Bolgani! I kill, Tarmangani!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" said the ape-man. \"I saved you from Histah.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did not come to kill Bolgani?\" inquired the gorilla.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. Let us be friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBolgani frowned in an effort to concentrate upon this remarkable\\r\\nproblem. Presently he spoke. \"We will be friends,\" he said. \"The\\r\\nTarmangani behind you will kill us both with his thunder stick. Let us\\r\\nkill him first.\" Painfully he staggered to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" remonstrated Tarzan. \"I will send the Tarmangani away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You? He will not go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle,\" replied the ape-man. \"The word of\\r\\nTarzan is law in the jungle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, who had been watching, was under the impression that the\\r\\nman and the beast were growling at one another and that a new duel\\r\\nimpended. Had he guessed the truth and suspicioned that they considered\\r\\nhim a common enemy he would have felt far less at ease. Now, his rifle\\r\\nregained, he started toward Tarzan just as the latter turned to address\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand to one side, young fellow,\" said Stimbol, \"while I finish that\\r\\ngorilla. After the experience you just had with the snake, I doubt if\\r\\nyou want that fellow to jump you, too.\" The American was none too sure\\r\\nof what the attitude of the white giant might be, for all too fresh\\r\\nin his mind was the startling and disconcerting manner of the wild\\r\\nman\\'s introduction; but he felt safe because he held a rifle, while\\r\\nthe other was unarmed, and he guessed that the giant might be only\\r\\ntoo glad to be saved from the attentions of the gorilla, which, from\\r\\nStimbol\\'s imagined knowledge of such beasts, appeared to him to be\\r\\nquite evidently threatening.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan halted directly between Bolgani and the hunter and eyed\\r\\nthe latter appraisingly for a moment. \"Lower your rifle,\" he said,\\r\\npresently. \"You are not going to shoot the gorilla.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hell I\\'m not!\" ejaculated Stimbol. \"What do you suppose I\\'ve been\\r\\nchasing him through the jungle for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Under a misapprehension,\" replied Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What misapprehension?\" demanded Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were going to shoot him. You are not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say, young man, do you know who I am?\" demanded Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not interested,\" replied Tarzan coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well you\\'d better be. I\\'m Wilbur Stimbol of Stimbol & Company,\\r\\nbrokers, New York!\" That was a name to conjure with--in New York. Even\\r\\nin Paris and London it had opened many a door, bent many a knee. Seldom\\r\\nhad it failed the purpose of this purse-arrogant man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing in my country?\" demanded the ape-man, ignoring\\r\\nStimbol\\'s egotistical statement of his identity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your country? Who the hell are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan turned toward the two blacks who had been standing a little in\\r\\nthe rear of Stimbol and to one side. \"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" he said\\r\\nto them in their own dialect. \"What is this man doing in my country?\\r\\nHow many are there in his party--how many white men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Big Bwana,\" replied one of the men with sincere deference, \"we knew\\r\\nthat you were Tarzan of the Apes when we saw you swing from the trees\\r\\nand slay the great snake. There is no other in all the jungle who could\\r\\ndo that. This white man is a bad master. There is one other white man\\r\\nwith him. The other is kind. They came to hunt Simba the lion and other\\r\\nbig game. They have had no luck. Tomorrow they turn back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is their camp?\" demanded Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black who had spoken pointed. \"It is not far,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man turned to Stimbol. \"Go back to your camp,\" he said.\\r\\n\"I shall come there later this evening and talk with you and your\\r\\ncompanion. In the meantime hunt no more except for food in Tarzan\\'s\\r\\ncountry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something in the voice and manner of the stranger that had\\r\\nfinally gone through Stimbol\\'s thick sensibilities and impressed him\\r\\nwith a species of awe--a thing he had scarcely ever experienced in the\\r\\npast except in the presence of wealth that was grossly superior to his\\r\\nown. He did not reply. He just stood and watched the bronzed giant turn\\r\\nto the gorilla. He heard them growl at one another for a moment and\\r\\nthen, to his vast surprise, he saw them move off through the jungle\\r\\ntogether, shoulder to shoulder. As the foliage closed about them he\\r\\nremoved his helmet and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a silken\\r\\nhandkerchief as he stood staring at the green branches that had parted\\r\\nto receive this strangely assorted pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally he turned to his men with an oath. \"A whole day wasted!\" he\\r\\ncomplained. \"Who is this fellow? You seemed to know him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is Tarzan,\" replied one of the blacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan? Never heard of him,\" snapped Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All who know the jungle, know Tarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humph!\" sneered Stimbol. \"No lousy wild man is going to tell Wilbur\\r\\nStimbol where he can hunt and where he can\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Master,\" said the black who had first spoken, \"the word of Tarzan is\\r\\nthe law of the jungle. Do not offend him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not paying you damned niggers for advice,\" snapped Stimbol. \"If\\r\\nI say hunt, we hunt, and don\\'t you forget it.\" But on their return to\\r\\ncamp they saw no game, or at least Stimbol saw none. What the blacks\\r\\nsaw was their own affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n                           _The Tarmangani_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Stimbol\\'s absence from camp Blake had been occupied in dividing\\r\\nthe food and equipment into two equal parts which were arranged for\\r\\nStimbol\\'s inspection and approval; but the division of the porters and\\r\\naskari he had left until the other\\'s return, and was writing in his\\r\\ndiary when the hunting party entered the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could see at a glance that Stimbol was in bad humor, but as that was\\r\\nthe older man\\'s usual state of temper it caused Blake no particular\\r\\nanxiety, but rather gave him cause for added relief that on the morrow\\r\\nhe would be rid of his ill-natured companion for good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was more concerned, however, by the sullen demeanor of the\\r\\naskari who had accompanied Stimbol for it meant to the younger man\\r\\nthat his companion had found some new occasion for bullying, abusing\\r\\nor insulting them, and the difficulty of dividing the safari thus\\r\\nincreased. Blake had felt from the moment that he had definitely\\r\\nreached the decision to separate from Stimbol that one of the greatest\\r\\nobstacles they would have to overcome to carry out the plan would be to\\r\\nfind sufficient men willing to submit themselves to Stimbol\\'s ideas of\\r\\ndiscipline, properly to transport his luggage and provisions and guard\\r\\nthem and him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Stimbol passed and saw the two piles of equipment the frown upon his\\r\\nface deepened. \"I see you\\'ve got the stuff laid out,\" he remarked, as\\r\\nhe halted before Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I wanted you to look it over and see that it is satisfactorily\\r\\ndivided before I have it packed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to be bothered with it,\" replied the other. \"I know you\\r\\nwouldn\\'t take any advantage of me on the division.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" replied Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How about the niggers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not going to be so easy. You know you haven\\'t treated them very\\r\\nwell and there will not be many of them anxious to return with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s where you\\'re dead wrong, Blake. The trouble with you is that\\r\\nyou don\\'t know anything about niggers. You\\'re too easy with \\'em. They\\r\\nhaven\\'t any respect for you, and the man they don\\'t respect they don\\'t\\r\\nlike. They know that a fellow who beats \\'em is their master, and they\\r\\nknow that a master is going to look after them. They wouldn\\'t want to\\r\\ntrust themselves on a long trek with you. You divided the junk, now let\\r\\nme handle the niggers--that\\'s more in my line--and I\\'ll see that you\\r\\nget a square deal and a good, safe bunch, and I\\'ll put the fear of God\\r\\ninto \\'em so they won\\'t dare be anything but loyal to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just how do you propose selecting the men?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, in the first place I\\'d like you to have those men who may wish\\r\\nto accompany you--I\\'ll grant there are a few--so we\\'ll just have \\'em\\r\\nall up, explain that we are separating, and I\\'ll tell all those who\\r\\nwish to return with your safari to step forward, then I\\'ll choose some\\r\\ngood men from what are left and make up enough that way to complete\\r\\nyour quota--see? That\\'s fair enough, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s quite fair,\" agreed Blake. He was hoping that the plan would work\\r\\nout as easily as Stimbol appeared to believe that it would, but he was\\r\\nfar from believing and so he thought it best to suggest an alternative\\r\\nthat he was confident would have to be resorted to in the end. \"In the\\r\\nevent that one of us has difficulty in securing the requisite number of\\r\\nvolunteers,\" he said, \"I believe that we can enlist the necessary men\\r\\nby offering a bonus to be paid upon safe arrival at railhead. If I am\\r\\nshort of men I shall be willing to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bad idea if you\\'re afraid you can\\'t hold \\'em together after\\r\\nI leave you,\" said Stimbol. \"It will be an added factor of safety\\r\\nfor you, too; but as for me my men will live up to their original\\r\\nagreement or there\\'ll be some mighty sick niggers in these parts. What\\r\\nsay we have \\'em up and find out just how much of a job we\\'ve got on\\r\\nour hands?\" He glanced about until his eyes fell on a head man. \"Here,\\r\\nyou!\" he called. \"Come here and make it snappy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black approached and stopped before the two white men. \"You called\\r\\nme, Bwana?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gather up everyone in camp,\" directed Stimbol. \"Have them up here in\\r\\nfive minutes for a palaver--every last man-jack of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Bwana.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the head man withdrew Stimbol turned to Blake. \"Any stranger in camp\\r\\ntoday?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ran across a wild man while I was hunting,\" replied Stimbol. \"He\\r\\nordered me out of the jungle. What do you know about that?\" and Stimbol\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A wild man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. Some crazy nut I suppose. The niggers seemed to know about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Calls himself Tarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake elevated his brows. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"You have met Tarzan of\\r\\nthe Apes and he has ordered you out of the jungle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve heard of him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, and if he ever orders me out of his jungle, I\\'ll go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You_ would, but not Wilbur Stimbol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did he order you out?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He just ordered me out, that\\'s all. Wouldn\\'t let me shoot a gorilla\\r\\nI\\'d been stalking. The fellow saved the gorilla from a python, killed\\r\\nthe python, ordered me out of the jungle, said he\\'d visit us in camp\\r\\nlater and walked away with the gorilla like they were old pals. I never\\r\\nsaw anything like it, but it doesn\\'t make any difference to me who or\\r\\nwhat he thinks he is, I know who and what I am and it\\'s going to take\\r\\nmore than a half-wit to scare me out of this country till I\\'m good and\\r\\nready to go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you think Tarzan of the Apes is a half-wit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think anyone\\'s a half-wit who\\'d run about this jungle naked and\\r\\nunarmed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find he\\'s not a half-wit, Stimbol; and unless you want to get\\r\\nin more trouble than you ever imagined existed, you\\'ll do just as\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes tells you to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about him? Have you ever seen him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Blake. \"But I have heard a lot about him from our men.\\r\\nHe\\'s as much a part of this locality as the jungle, or the lions. Very\\r\\nfew, if any, of our men have seen him, but he has the same hold upon\\r\\ntheir imaginations and superstitions as any of their demons, and they\\r\\nare even more fearful of incurring his displeasure. If they think\\r\\nTarzan has it in for us we\\'re out of luck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I\\'ve got to say is that if this monkey-man knows when he\\'s\\r\\nwell off he\\'ll not come butting into the affairs of Wilbur Stimbol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he\\'s coming to visit us, is he?\" said Blake. \"Well, I certainly\\r\\nwant to see him. I\\'ve heard of little else since we struck his country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s funny I never heard of him,\" said Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You never talk with the men,\" Blake reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gad, it seems as though I\\'m doing nothing but talk to them,\" grumbled\\r\\nStimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said, talk _with_ them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t chum with niggers,\" sneered Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake grinned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are the men,\" said Stimbol. He turned toward the waiting porters\\r\\nand askari and cleared his throat. \"Mr. Blake and I are going to\\r\\nseparate,\" he announced. \"Everything has been divided. I am going to\\r\\nhunt a little farther to the west, make a circle toward the south and\\r\\nreturn to the coast by a new route. I do not know what Mr. Blake\\'s\\r\\nplans are, but he is going to get half the porters and half the askari,\\r\\nand I want to tell you niggers right now that there isn\\'t going to\\r\\nbe any funny business about it. Half of you are going with Mr. Blake\\r\\nwhether you like it or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, impressively, to let the full weight of his pronouncement\\r\\nsink home. \"As usual,\" he continued, \"I wish to keep everyone contented\\r\\nand happy, so I\\'m going to give you who may want to go with Mr. Blake\\r\\nan opportunity to do so. Now listen! The packs over on that side are\\r\\nMr. Blake\\'s; those on this side are mine. All those who are willing to\\r\\naccompany Mr. Blake go over on that side!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s hesitation upon the part of the men and then\\r\\nsome of them moved quietly over among Blake\\'s packs. Others followed\\r\\nas their understandings slowly grasped the meaning of Stimbol\\'s words\\r\\nuntil all of the men stood upon Blake\\'s side.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol turned to Blake with a laugh and a shake of his head. \"Gad!\"\\r\\nhe exclaimed. \"Did you ever see such a dumb bunch? No one could have\\r\\nexplained the thing more simply than I and yet look at \\'em! Not one of\\r\\nthem understood me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure of that, Stimbol?\" inquired Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol did not immediately grasp the insinuation. When he did he\\r\\nscowled. \"Don\\'t be a fool,\" he snapped. \"Of course they misunderstood\\r\\nme.\" He turned angrily toward the men. \"You thick-skulled, black\\r\\nidiots! Can\\'t you understand anything?\" he demanded. \"I did not say\\r\\nthat you all had to go with Mr. Blake--only those who wished to. Now\\r\\nthe rest of you--those who wish to accompany me--get back over here on\\r\\nthis side with my packs, and step lively!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one moved in the direction of Stimbol\\'s packs. The man flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is mutiny!\" he stormed. \"Whoever is at the bottom of this is\\r\\ngoing to suffer. Come here, you!\" He motioned to a head man. \"Who put\\r\\nyou fellows up to this? Has Mr. Blake been telling you what to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be a fool, Stimbol,\" said Blake. \"No one has influenced the men\\r\\nand there is no mutiny. The plan was yours. The men have done just what\\r\\nyou told them to. If it had not been for your insufferable egotism you\\r\\nwould have known precisely what the outcome would be. These black men\\r\\nare human beings. In some respects they are extremely sensitive human\\r\\nbeings, and in many ways they are like children. You strike them, you\\r\\ncurse them, you insult them and they will fear you and hate you. You\\r\\nhave done all these things to them and they do fear you and hate you.\\r\\nYou have sowed and now you are reaping. I hope to God that it will\\r\\nteach you a lesson. There is just one way to get your men and that is\\r\\nto offer them a big bonus. Are you willing to do that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, his self assurance momentarily shaken at last, wilted in\\r\\nthe face of the realization that Blake was right. He looked about\\r\\nhelplessly for a moment. The blacks, sullen-faced, stood there like\\r\\ndumb beasts, staring at him. In all those eyes there was no single\\r\\nfriendly glance. He turned back to Blake. \"See what you can do with\\r\\nthem,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake faced the men. \"It will be necessary for half of you to\\r\\naccompany Mr. Stimbol back to the coast,\" he said. \"He will pay double\\r\\nwages to all those who go with him, provided that you serve him\\r\\nloyally. Talk it over among yourselves and send word to us later by\\r\\nyour head man. That is all. You may go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe balance of the afternoon passed, the two white men keeping to their\\r\\nrespective tents; the blacks gathered in groups, whispering. Blake and\\r\\nStimbol no longer messed together, but after the evening meal each\\r\\nappeared with his pipe to await the report of the head men. After half\\r\\nan hour Blake sent his boy to summon them and presently they came and\\r\\nstood before the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, have the men decided who will accompany Mr. Stimbol?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one will accompany the old bwana,\" replied their spokesman. \"All\\r\\nwill go with the young bwana.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mr. Stimbol will pay them well,\" Blake reminded, \"and half of you\\r\\nmust go with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black shook his head. \"He could not make the pay big enough,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"No boy will go with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You agreed to come out with us and return with us,\" said Blake. \"You\\r\\nmust fulfil your agreement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We agreed to come out with both of you and return with both of you.\\r\\nThere was nothing said about returning separately. We will live up to\\r\\nour agreement and the old bwana may return in safety with the young\\r\\nbwana.\" There was finality in the tone of the spokesman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake thought for a moment before replying. \"You may go,\" he said. \"I\\r\\nwill talk with you again in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blacks had departed but a moment when the figure of a man appeared\\r\\nsuddenly out of the darkness into the light of the camp fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who the--oh, it\\'s you is it?\" exclaimed Stimbol. \"Here\\'s the wild man,\\r\\nBlake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young American turned and surveyed the figure of the bronze giant\\r\\nwho was standing just within the circle of the firelight. He noted the\\r\\nclean cut features, the quiet dignity, the majestic mien and smiled\\r\\ninwardly at recollection of Stimbol\\'s description of this god-like\\r\\ncreature--half-wit!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you are Tarzan of the Apes!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan inclined his head. \"And you?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Jim Blake of New York,\" replied the American.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hunting of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With a camera.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your companion was using a rifle,\" Tarzan reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not responsible for his acts. I cannot control them,\" replied\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor anyone else,\" snapped Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan permitted his gaze to move to Stimbol for an instant, but\\r\\nignored his boast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I overheard the conversation between you and the head men,\" he said,\\r\\naddressing Blake. \"Some of your blacks had already told me something\\r\\nabout your companion, and twice today I have had an opportunity to form\\r\\nan estimate of my own from personal observation, so I assume that you\\r\\nare separating because you cannot agree. Am I right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" acknowledged Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And after you separate--what are your plans?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I intend to push in a little farther west and then swing----\"\\r\\ncommenced Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was speaking to Blake,\" interrupted Tarzan; \"my plans concerning you\\r\\nare already made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, who the----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Silence!\" admonished the ape-man. \"Go ahead, Blake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not had much luck so far,\" replied Blake, \"principally because\\r\\nwe never can agree on methods. The result is that I have scarcely a\\r\\nsingle decent wild animal study. I had planned to go north a way in\\r\\nsearch of lion pictures. I dislike going back without anything to show\\r\\nfor the time and money I have put into the expedition, but now that the\\r\\nmen have refused to accompany us separately there is nothing for it but\\r\\nto return to the coast by the shortest route.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You two don\\'t seem to be taking me into consideration at all,\"\\r\\ngrumbled Stimbol. \"I\\'ve got as much money and time in this trip as\\r\\nBlake. You forget that I\\'m here to hunt, and what\\'s more I\\'m going to\\r\\nhunt and I\\'m not going straight back to the coast by a damned sight,\\r\\nmonkey-man or no monkey-man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Tarzan ignored Stimbol. \"Get ready to move out about an hour\\r\\nafter sunrise,\" he said to Blake. \"There will be no trouble about\\r\\ndividing the safari. I shall be here to attend to that and give you\\r\\nyour final instructions,\" and as he spoke he turned and disappeared in\\r\\nthe darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _Ara the Lightning_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore dawn the camp was astir and by the appointed hour the packs were\\r\\nmade and all was in readiness. The porters loitered, awaiting the word\\r\\nthat would start the safari upon its eastward journey toward the coast.\\r\\nBlake and Stimbol smoked in silence. The foliage of a nearby tree moved\\r\\nto the swaying of a branch and Tarzan of the Apes dropped lightly\\r\\ninto the camp. Exclamations of surprise broke from the lips of the\\r\\nnegroes--surprise clearly tinged with terror. The ape-man turned toward\\r\\nthem and addressed them in their own dialect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" he said, \"Lord of the Jungle. You have\\r\\nbrought white men into my country to kill my people. I am displeased.\\r\\nThose of you who wish to live to return to your villages and your\\r\\nfamilies will listen well and do as Tarzan commands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You,\" he pointed at the chief head man, \"shall accompany the younger\\r\\nwhite man whom I will permit to make pictures in my country where and\\r\\nwhen he will. Select half the men of the safari to accompany the young\\r\\nbwana.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you,\" he addressed another head man, \"take those men that remain\\r\\nand escort the older bwana to railhead in the most direct route and\\r\\nwithout delay. He is not permitted to hunt and there will be no killing\\r\\nexcept for food or self-defense. Do not fail me. Remember always that\\r\\nTarzan watches and Tarzan never forgets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned then to the white men. \"Blake,\" he said, \"the arrangements\\r\\nare made. You may leave when you please, with your own safari, and\\r\\ngo where you please. The question of hunting is left to your own\\r\\ndiscretion--you are the guest of Tarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you,\" he addressed Stimbol, \"will be taken directly out of the\\r\\ncountry by the shortest route. You will be permitted to carry firearms\\r\\nfor use in self-defense. If you abuse this permission they will be\\r\\ntaken away from you. Do not hunt, even for food--your head man will\\r\\nattend to that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now just hold your horses,\" blustered Stimbol. \"If you think I\\'m going\\r\\nto put up with any such high-handed interference with my rights as an\\r\\nAmerican citizen you\\'re very much mistaken. Why I could buy and sell\\r\\nyou and your damned jungle forty times and not know that I\\'d spent a\\r\\ncent. For God\\'s sake, Blake, tell this poor fool who I am before he\\r\\ngets himself into a lot of trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan turned to the head man he had selected for Stimbol. \"You may\\r\\nup-load and march,\" he said. \"If this white man does not follow you,\\r\\nleave him behind. Take good care of him if he obeys me and deliver him\\r\\nsafely at railhead. Obey his orders if they do not conflict with those\\r\\nthat I have given you. Go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later Stimbol\\'s safari was preparing to depart and, at\\r\\nTarzan\\'s request, Blake\\'s too was moving out of camp. Stimbol swore\\r\\nand threatened, but his men, sullenly ignoring him, filed off into the\\r\\njungle toward the east. Tarzan had departed, swinging into the trees\\r\\nand disappearing among the foliage, and at last Stimbol stood alone in\\r\\nthe deserted camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThwarted, humiliated, almost frothing with rage he ran after his men,\\r\\nscreaming commands and threats that were ignored. Later in the day,\\r\\nsullen and silent, he marched near the head of the long file of porters\\r\\nand askari, convinced at last that the power of the ape-man was greater\\r\\nthan his; but in his heart burned resentment and in his mind rioted\\r\\nplans for vengeance--plans that he knew were futile.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan, wishing to assure himself that his instructions were being\\r\\ncarried out, had swung far ahead and was waiting in the crotch of a\\r\\ntree that overhung the trail along which Stimbol must pass. In the\\r\\ndistance he could hear the sounds that arose from the marching safari.\\r\\nAlong the trail from the opposite direction something was approaching.\\r\\nThe ape-man could not see it but he knew what it was. Above the tree\\r\\ntops black clouds rolled low, but no air stirred in the jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the trail came a great, shaggy, black man-thing. Tarzan of the\\r\\nApes hailed it as it came in sight of his arboreal perch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bolgani!\" he called in low tones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gorilla stopped. He stood erect upon his hind feet and looked about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan,\" said the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBolgani grunted. \"I am Bolgani,\" he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Tarmangani comes,\" warned Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I kill!\" growled Bolgani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the Tarmangani pass,\" said Tarzan. \"He and his people have many\\r\\nthunder sticks. I have sent this Tarmangani out of the jungle. Let him\\r\\npass. Go a little way from the trail--the stupid Gomangani and the\\r\\nTarmangani, who is stupider, will pass by without knowing that Tarzan\\r\\nand Bolgani are near.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the darkening sky distant thunder boomed and the two beasts looked\\r\\nupward toward the broad field of Nature\\'s powers, more savage and\\r\\ndestructive than their own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pand the thunder hunts in the sky,\" remarked the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hunts for Usha the wind,\" said Bolgani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Presently we shall hear Usha fleeing through the trees to escape.\"\\r\\nTarzan viewed the lowering, black clouds. \"Even Kudu the sun fears\\r\\nPand, hiding his face when Pand hunts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAra the lightning shot through the sky. To the two beasts it was a bolt\\r\\nfrom Pand\\'s bow and the great drops of rain that commenced to fall\\r\\nshortly after was Meeta, the blood of Usha the wind, pouring from many\\r\\na wound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jungle bent to a great pressure but as yet there was no other noise\\r\\nthan the rolling thunder. The trees whipped back and Usha tore through\\r\\nthe forest. The darkness increased. The rain fell in great masses.\\r\\nLeaves and branches hurtled through the air, trees crashed amongst\\r\\ntheir fellows. With deafening roars the elements unleashed their pent\\r\\nanger. The beasts cowered beneath the one awe inspiring power that they\\r\\nacknowledged as supreme.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan crouched in the crotch of a great tree with his shoulders\\r\\narched against the beating rain. Just off the trail Bolgani squatted\\r\\nin drenched and bedraggled misery. They waited. There was nothing else\\r\\nthat they could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove them the storm broke again with maniacal fury. The thunder\\r\\ncrashed with deafening reverberation. There was a blinding flash of\\r\\nlight and the branch upon which Tarzan squatted sagged and hurtled to\\r\\nthe trail beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nStunned, the ape-man lay where he had fallen, the great branch\\r\\npartially across his body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs quickly as it had come, the storm departed. Kudu the sun burst\\r\\nthrough the clouds. Bolgani, dejected and still terrified, remained\\r\\nwhere he had squatted, motionless and silent. Bolgani had no desire to\\r\\nattract the attention of Pand the thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoaked with water, cold, furious, Stimbol slopped along the slippery,\\r\\nmuddy trail. He did not know that his safari was some little distance\\r\\nbehind him, for he had forged ahead during the storm while they had\\r\\ntaken refuge beneath the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a turn in the trail he came suddenly upon a fallen branch that\\r\\nblocked the way. At first he did not see the body of the man lying\\r\\nbeneath it, but when he did he recognized it instantly and a new hope\\r\\nsprang to life within his breast. With Tarzan dead he could be free to\\r\\ndo as he pleased; but was the ape-man dead?\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol ran forward and, kneeling, placed an ear to the breast\\r\\nof the prostrate figure. An expression of disappointment crossed\\r\\nhis face--Tarzan was not dead. The expression upon Stimbol\\'s face\\r\\nchanged--a cunning look came into his eyes as he glanced back down the\\r\\ntrail. His men were not in sight! He looked quickly about him. He was\\r\\nalone with the unconscious author of his humiliation!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought he was alone. He did not see the shaggy figure that had\\r\\nsilently arisen as the sound of Stimbol\\'s approach had come to its\\r\\nsensitive ears and was now peering at him through the foliage--peering\\r\\nat him and at the silent figure of the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol drew his hunting knife from its scabbard. He could slip its\\r\\npoint into the wild man\\'s heart and run back down the trail. His men\\r\\nwould find him waiting for them. Later they would come upon the dead\\r\\nTarzan, but they would not guess how he had met his end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man moved--consciousness was returning. Stimbol realized that\\r\\nhe must act quickly, and at the same instant a great hairy arm reached\\r\\nout through the foliage and a mighty hand closed upon his shoulder.\\r\\nWith a screaming curse he turned to look into the hideous face of\\r\\nBolgani. He tried to strike at the shaggy breast of his antagonist with\\r\\nhis hunting knife, but the puny weapon was torn from his grasp and\\r\\nhurled into the bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great yellow fangs were bared against Stimbol\\'s throat as Tarzan\\r\\nopened his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kreeg-ah!\" cried the ape-man in warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBolgani paused and looked at his fellow beast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him go,\" said Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Tarmangani would have killed Tarzan,\" explained the gorilla.\\r\\n\"Bolgani stopped him. Bolgani kill!\" He growled horribly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" snapped Tarzan. \"Free the Tarmangani!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gorilla released his grasp upon Stimbol just as the first of the\\r\\nhunter\\'s men came in sight of them, and as Bolgani saw the blacks and\\r\\nhow numerous they were his nervousness and irritability increased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take to the jungle, Bolgani,\" said Tarzan. \"Tarzan will take care of\\r\\nthis Tarmangani and the Gomangani.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a parting growl the gorilla merged with the foliage and the\\r\\nshadows of the jungle as Tarzan of the Apes faced Stimbol and his boys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had a close call then, Stimbol,\" said the ape-man. \"It is\\r\\nfortunate for you that you didn\\'t succeed in killing me. I was here for\\r\\ntwo reasons. One was to see that you obeyed my instructions and the\\r\\nother to protect you from your men. I did not like the way they eyed\\r\\nyou in camp this morning. It would not be a difficult thing to lose you\\r\\nin the jungle, you know, and that would put a period to you as surely\\r\\nas poison or a knife. I felt a certain responsibility for you because\\r\\nyou are a white man, but you have just now released me from whatever\\r\\nobligation racial ties may have influenced me to acknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not kill you, Stimbol, as you deserve; but from now on you\\r\\nmay reach the coast on your own, and you will doubtless discover that\\r\\none cannot make too many friends in the jungle or afford a single\\r\\nunnecessary enemy.\" He wheeled upon Stimbol\\'s black boys. \"Tarzan of\\r\\nthe Apes goes his way. You will not see him again, perhaps. Do your\\r\\nduty by this white man as long as he obeys the word of Tarzan; _but see\\r\\nthat he does not hunt_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this final admonition the ape-man swung into the lower branches\\r\\nand was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Stimbol, after repeatedly questioning his men, discovered that\\r\\nTarzan had practically assured them that they would see no more of\\r\\nhim, he regained much of his former assurance and egotistical bluster.\\r\\nOnce more he was the leader of men, shouting at the blacks in a loud\\r\\ntone, cursing them, ridiculing them. He thought that it impressed them\\r\\nwith his greatness. He believed that they were simple people whom he\\r\\ncould deceive into thinking that he was not afraid of Tarzan, and by\\r\\nflaunting Tarzan\\'s commands win their respect. Now that Tarzan had\\r\\npromised not to return Stimbol felt safer in ignoring his wishes, and\\r\\nso it befell that just before they reached a camping ground Stimbol\\r\\ncame upon an antelope and without an instant\\'s hesitation fired and\\r\\nkilled it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sullen camp that Stimbol made that night. The men gathered in\\r\\ngroups and whispered. \"He has shot an antelope and Tarzan will be angry\\r\\nwith us,\" said one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He will punish us,\" said a head man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bwana is a bad man,\" said another. \"I wish he was dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may not kill him. Tarzan has said that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we leave him in the jungle he will die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan told us to do our duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said to do it as long as the bad bwana obeyed the commands of\\r\\nTarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has disobeyed them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we may leave him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, exhausted by the long march, slept like a log. When he awoke\\r\\nthe sun was high. He shouted for his boy. There was no response. Again\\r\\nhe shouted and louder, adding an oath. No one came. There was no sound\\r\\nin camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lazy niggers,\" he grumbled. \"They\\'ll step a little livelier when I\\r\\nget out there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe arose and dressed, but as he was dressing the silence of the camp\\r\\ncame to impress him as something almost menacing, so that he hastened\\r\\nto be through and out of the tent. As he stepped into the open the\\r\\ntruth was revealed at almost the first quick glance about. Not a human\\r\\nbeing was in sight and all but one of the packs containing provisions\\r\\nwere gone. He had been deserted in the heart of Africa!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first impulse was to seize his rifle and start after the blacks,\\r\\nbut second thought impressed him with the danger of such procedure\\r\\nand convinced him that the last thing he should do would be to place\\r\\nhimself again in the power of these men who had demonstrated that they\\r\\nfelt no compunction in abandoning him to almost certain death. If they\\r\\nwanted to be rid of him they could easily find even a quicker means if\\r\\nhe returned and forced himself upon them again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was but a single alternative and that was to find Blake and\\r\\nremain with him. He knew that Blake would not abandon him to death in\\r\\nthe jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blacks had not left him without provisions, nor had they taken his\\r\\nrifle or ammunition, but the difficulty that now confronted Stimbol was\\r\\nlargely in the matter of transportation for his food. There was plenty\\r\\nof it to last many days, but he knew that he could not carry it through\\r\\nthe jungle together with his rifle and ammunition. To remain where the\\r\\nfood was would be equally futile. Blake was returning to the coast by\\r\\nanother route; the ape-man had said that he would not follow Stimbol\\'s\\r\\nsafari farther; it might be years, therefore, before another human\\r\\nbeing chanced along this little used game trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew that he and Blake were now separated by about two marches and\\r\\nif he travelled light and Blake did not march too rapidly he might hope\\r\\nto overtake him inside a week. Perhaps Blake would find good camera\\r\\nhunting soon and make a permanent camp. In that case Stimbol would find\\r\\nhim even more quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt better when he had definitely decided upon a plan of action,\\r\\nand after a good breakfast he made up a small pack of provisions,\\r\\nenough to last him a week, filled his belts and pockets with ammunition\\r\\nand started off along the back trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy going for the trail of the day before was plain and\\r\\nthis was the third time that Stimbol had been over it, so he had no\\r\\ndifficulty in reaching the camp at which he and Blake had parted\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he entered the little clearing early in the afternoon he determined\\r\\nto keep on and cover as much ground on Blake\\'s trail as he could before\\r\\ndark, but for a few minutes he would rest. As he sat down with his back\\r\\nagainst the bole of a tree he did not notice a movement of the tops of\\r\\na clump of jungle grasses a few yards distant, and if he had he would,\\r\\ndoubtless, have attached no importance to the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinishing a cigarette Stimbol arose, rearranged his pack and started\\r\\noff in the direction Blake\\'s men had taken early the preceding morning;\\r\\nbut he had covered but a yard or two when he was brought to a sudden\\r\\nhalt by an ominous growl that arose from a little clump of jungle\\r\\ngrasses close in front of him. Almost simultaneously the fringing\\r\\ngrasses parted and there appeared in the opening the head of a great\\r\\nblack-maned lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a scream of fear, Stimbol dropped his pack, threw aside his rifle\\r\\nand started on a run for the tree beneath which he had been sitting.\\r\\nThe lion, itself somewhat surprised, stood for an instant watching him\\r\\nand then started in pursuit at an easy lope.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, casting an affrighted glance rearward, was horrified--the lion\\r\\nseemed so close and the tree so far away. If distance lends enchantment\\r\\nto the view, proximity may also at times have its advantage. In this\\r\\ninstance it served to accelerate the speed of the fleeing man to a most\\r\\nsurprising degree, and though he was no longer young he clawed his way\\r\\nto the lower branches of the tree with speed, if not with grace, that\\r\\nwould have done justice to a trained athlete.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was he an instant too speedy. Numa\\'s raking talons touched his boot\\r\\nand sent him swarming up among the higher branches, where he clung weak\\r\\nand panting looking down into the snarling visage of the carnivore.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Numa growled up at him and then, with a coughing grunt,\\r\\nturned away and strode majestically in the direction of the clump of\\r\\ngrasses from which he had emerged. He stopped to sniff at the pack of\\r\\nprovisions Stimbol had discarded and, evidently piqued by the man scent\\r\\nclinging to it, cuffed at it angrily. It rolled to one side and Numa\\r\\nstepped back, eyeing it warily, then, with a growl, he leaped upon it\\r\\nand commenced to maul the insensate thing, ripping and tearing until\\r\\nits contents were scattered about upon the ground. He bit into tins and\\r\\nboxes until scarcely an article remained intact, while Stimbol crouched\\r\\nin the tree and watched the destruction of his provisions, utterly\\r\\nhelpless to interfere.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dozen times he cursed himself for having thrown away his rifle and\\r\\neven more frequently he vowed vengeance. He consoled himself, however,\\r\\nwith the realization that Blake could not be far away and that with\\r\\nBlake there were ample provisions which could be augmented by trading\\r\\nand hunting. When the lion left he would descend and follow Blake\\'s\\r\\ntrail.\\r\\n\\r\\nNuma, tired of the contents of the pack, resumed his way toward the\\r\\nlong grass, but again his attention was distracted--this time by the\\r\\nthunder stick of the Tarmangani. The lion smelled of the discarded\\r\\nrifle, pawed it and finally picked it up between his jaws. Stimbol\\r\\nlooked on, horrified. What if the beast damaged the weapon? He would be\\r\\nleft without means of defense or for obtaining food!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drop it!\" shouted Stimbol. \"Drop it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNuma, ignoring the ravings of the despised man-thing, strode into his\\r\\nlair, carrying the rifle with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon and night spelled an eternity of terror for Wilbur\\r\\nStimbol. While daylight lasted the lion remained in the nearby patch\\r\\nof grass effectually deterring the unhappy man from continuing his\\r\\nsearch for Blake\\'s camp, and after night fell no urge whatever could\\r\\nhave induced Stimbol to descend to the paralyzing terrors of the jungle\\r\\nnight even had he known that the lion had departed and no sounds had\\r\\napprised him of the near presence of danger; but sounds did apprise\\r\\nhim. From shortly after dark until nearly dawn a perfect bedlam of\\r\\nhowls and growls and coughs and grunts and barks arose from directly\\r\\nbeneath him as there had been held a convention of all the horrid\\r\\nbeasts of the jungle at the foot of the tree that seemed at best an\\r\\nextremely insecure sanctuary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen morning came the jungle lay silent and peaceful about him and\\r\\nonly torn canvas and empty cans bore mute evidence to the feast of\\r\\nthe hyenas that had passed into jungle history. Numa had departed\\r\\nleaving the remains of the kill upon which he had lain as the piece de\\r\\nresistance of the hyenian banquet for which Stimbol had furnished the\\r\\nhors d\\'oeuvres.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, trembling, descended. Through the jungle, wild-eyed, startled\\r\\nby every sound, scurried a pitiful figure of broken, terror stricken\\r\\nold age. Few could have recognized in it Wilbur Stimbol of Stimbol &\\r\\nCompany, brokers, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n                              _The Cross_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm that had overtaken Stimbol\\'s safari wrought even greater\\r\\nhavoc with the plans of Jim Blake, altering in the instant of a single\\r\\nblinding flash of lightning the course of his entire life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccompanied by a single black, who carried his camera and an extra\\r\\nrifle, Blake had struck out from the direct route of his safari in\\r\\nsearch of lion pictures, there being every indication that the great\\r\\ncarnivores might be found in abundance in the district through which\\r\\nthey were passing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was his intention to parallel the route of his main body and\\r\\nrejoin it in camp in the afternoon. The boy who accompanied him was\\r\\nintelligent and resourceful, the direction and speed of the marching\\r\\nsafari were mutually agreed upon and the responsibility for bringing\\r\\nBlake into camp safely was left entirely to the negro. Having every\\r\\nconfidence in the boy, Blake gave no heed to either time or direction,\\r\\ndevoting all his energies to the fascinating occupation of searching\\r\\nfor photographic studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after leaving the safari Blake and his companion encountered a\\r\\nherd of seven or eight lions which included a magnificent old male, an\\r\\nold lioness and five or six young, ranging from half to full grown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sight of Blake and his companion the lions took off leisurely\\r\\nthrough rather open forest and the men followed, awaiting patiently the\\r\\nhappy coincidence of time, light and grouping that would give the white\\r\\nman such a picture as he desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mind of the black man was pictured the route of the safari and\\r\\nits relation to the meanderings of the quarry. He knew how far and\\r\\nin what directions he and his companion were being led from their\\r\\ndestination. To have returned to the trail of the safari would have\\r\\nbeen a simple matter to him, but Blake, depending entirely upon the\\r\\nblack, gave no heed either to time or direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two hours they clung doggedly to the spoor, encouraged by\\r\\noccasional glimpses of now one, now several members of the regal group,\\r\\nbut never was the opportunity afforded for a successful shot. Then the\\r\\nsky became rapidly overcast by black clouds and a few moments later\\r\\nthe storm broke in all the terrific fury that only an Equatorial storm\\r\\ncan achieve, and an instant later amidst the deafening roar of thunder\\r\\nand a blinding flash of lightning utter disaster engulfed James Hunter\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long he lay, stunned by the shock of the bolt that had struck but\\r\\na few feet from him, he did not know. When he opened his eyes the storm\\r\\nhad passed and the sun was shining brightly through the leafy canopy\\r\\nof the forest. Still dazed, uncomprehending the cause or extent of the\\r\\ncatastrophe, he raised himself slowly upon an elbow and looked about\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first sights that met his eyes aided materially in the rapid\\r\\nrecovery of his senses. Less than a hundred feet from him stood a group\\r\\nof lions, seven of them, solemnly regarding him. The characteristics\\r\\nof individual lions differ as greatly from those of their fellows as\\r\\ndo the characteristics of individuals of the human race and, even\\r\\nas a human being, a lion may have his moods as well as his personal\\r\\nidiosyncrasies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese lions that gravely inspected the man-thing had been spared any\\r\\nconsiderable experience with the human species; they had seen but\\r\\nfew men; they had never been hunted; they were well fed; Blake had\\r\\ndone nothing greatly to upset their easily irritated nervous systems.\\r\\nFortunately for him they were merely curious.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Blake did not know all this. He knew only that seven lions were\\r\\nstanding within a hundred feet of him, that they were not in a cage and\\r\\nthat while he had pursued them to obtain photographs, the thing that he\\r\\nmost desired at the moment was not his camera but his rifle.\\r\\n\\r\\nStealthily, that he might not annoy them, he looked about him for the\\r\\nweapon. To his consternation it was nowhere in sight, nor was his\\r\\ngun bearer with the extra rifle. Where could the boy be? Doubtless,\\r\\nfrightened by the lions, he had decamped. Twenty feet away was a most\\r\\ninviting tree. Blake wondered if the lions would charge the moment that\\r\\nhe rose to his feet. He tried to remember all that he had heard about\\r\\nlions and he did recall one fact that applies with almost axiomatic\\r\\nverity to all dangerous animals--if you run from them they will pursue\\r\\nyou. To reach the tree it would be necessary to walk almost directly\\r\\ntoward the lions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was in a quandary, and then one of the younger lions moved a few\\r\\nsteps nearer! That settled the matter as far as Blake was concerned,\\r\\nfor the closer the lions came the shorter his chance of gaining the\\r\\ntree ahead of them in the event that they elected to prevent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of a tremendous forest, entirely surrounded by trees,\\r\\nNature had chosen to strike him down almost in the center of a natural\\r\\nclearing. There was a good tree a hundred feet away and on the opposite\\r\\nside of the clearing from the lions. Blake stole a longing glance at\\r\\nit and then achieved some rapid mental calculations. If he ran for the\\r\\nfarther tree the lions would have to cover two hundred feet while he\\r\\nwas covering one hundred, while if he chose the nearer tree, they must\\r\\ncome eighty feet while he was going twenty. There seemed, therefore,\\r\\nno doubt as to the greater desirability of the nearer tree which ruled\\r\\nfavorite by odds of two to one. Against it, however, loomed the mental\\r\\nhazard that running straight into the face of seven lions involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Blake was sincerely, genuinely and honestly scared; but unless the\\r\\nlions were psychoanalysts they would never have dreamed the truth as\\r\\nhe started nonchalantly and slowly toward them--and the tree. The most\\r\\ndifficult feat that he had ever accomplished lay in making his legs\\r\\nbehave themselves. They wanted to run. So did his feet and his heart\\r\\nand his brain. Only his will held them in leash.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose were tense moments for Jim Blake--the first half dozen steps\\r\\nhe took with seven great lions watching his approach. He saw that\\r\\nthey were becoming nervous. The lioness moved uneasily. The old male\\r\\ngrowled. A younger male, he who had started forward, lashed his sides\\r\\nwith his tail, flattened his head, bared his fangs and stealthily\\r\\napproached.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was almost at the tree when something happened--he never knew\\r\\nwhat the cause, but inexplicably the lioness turned and bounded away,\\r\\nvoicing a low whine, and after her went the other six.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man leaned against the bole of the tree and fanned himself with\\r\\nhis helmet. \"Whew!\" he breathed, \"I hope the next lion I see is in the\\r\\nCentral Park Zoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even lions were forgotten in the developments that the next few\\r\\nmoments revealed after repeated shouts for the black boy had brought\\r\\nno response and Blake had determined that he must set out in search\\r\\nof him. Nor did he have far to go. On the back track, just inside the\\r\\nclearing, Blake found a few remnants of charred flesh and a blackened\\r\\nand half molten rifle barrel. Of the camera not a vestige remained.\\r\\nThe bolt that had bowled Blake over must have squarely struck his gun\\r\\nbearer, killing him instantly, exploding all the ammunition, destroying\\r\\nthe camera and ruining the rifle that he had carried.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what had become of the rifle that had been in Blake\\'s hands? The\\r\\nman searched in all directions, but could not find it and was finally\\r\\nforced to the conclusion that its disappearance could be attributed\\r\\nonly to one of those freakish tricks which severe electrical storms so\\r\\noften play upon helpless and futile humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankly aware that he was lost and had not the faintest conception\\r\\nof the direction in which lay the proposed camp of his safari, Blake\\r\\nstarted blindly off on what he devoutly hoped would prove the right\\r\\nroute. It was not. His safari was moving northeast. Blake headed north.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days he trudged on through dense forest, sleeping at night\\r\\namong the branches of trees. Once his fitful slumbers were disturbed\\r\\nby the swaying of a branch against which he was braced. As he awoke he\\r\\nfelt it sag as to the weight of some large animal. He looked and saw\\r\\ntwo fiery eyes gleaming in the dark. Blake knew it to be a leopard as\\r\\nhe drew his automatic and fired point blank. With a hideous scream the\\r\\ngreat cat sprang or fell to the ground. Blake never knew if he hit it.\\r\\nIt did not return and there were no signs of it in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found food and water in abundance, and upon the morning of the\\r\\nthird day he emerged from the forest at the foot of a range of lofty\\r\\nmountains and for the first time in weeks reveled in an unobstructed\\r\\nview of the blue sky and saw the horizon again and all that lay between\\r\\nhimself and it. He had not realized that he had been depressed by the\\r\\ndarkness and the crowding pressure of the trees, but now he experienced\\r\\nall the spiritual buoyancy of a released convict long immured from\\r\\nfreedom and the light of day. Rescue was no longer problematical,\\r\\nmerely a matter of time. He wanted to sing and shout; but he conserved\\r\\nhis energies and started toward the mountains. There had been no native\\r\\nvillages in the forest and so, he reasoned, as there must be native\\r\\nvillages in a well-watered country stocked with game, he would find\\r\\nthem upon the mountain slopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopping a rise he saw below him the mouth of a canyon in the bed of\\r\\nwhich ran a small stream. A village would be built on water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he followed the water he would come to the village. Quite easy! He\\r\\ndescended to the stream where he was deeply gratified to find that a\\r\\nwell-worn path paralleled it. Encouraged by the belief that he would\\r\\nsoon encounter natives and believing that he would have no difficulty\\r\\nin enlisting their services in aiding him to relocate his safari, Blake\\r\\nfollowed the path upward into the canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had covered something like three miles without having discovered\\r\\nany sign of habitation when, at a turn in the path, he found himself\\r\\nat the foot of a great white cross of enormous proportions. Hewn\\r\\nfrom limestone, it stood directly in the center of the trail and\\r\\ntowered above him fully sixty feet. Checked and weatherworn, it gave\\r\\nan impression of great antiquity, which was further borne out by the\\r\\nremains of an almost obliterated inscription upon the face of its\\r\\nmassive base.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake examined the carved letters, but could not decipher their\\r\\nmessage. The characters appeared of early English origin, but he\\r\\ndismissed such a possibility as too ridiculous to entertain. He knew\\r\\nthat he could not be far from the southern boundary of Abyssinia and\\r\\nthat the Abyssinians are Christians. Thus he explained the presence of\\r\\nthe cross; but he could not explain the suggestion of sinister menace\\r\\nthat this lonely, ancient symbol of the crucifix held for him. Why was\\r\\nit? What was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding there, tongueless, hoary with age, it seemed to call upon him\\r\\nto stop, to venture not beyond it into the unknown; it warned him back,\\r\\nbut not, seemingly, out of a spirit of kindliness and protection, but\\r\\nrather with arrogance and hate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a laugh Blake threw off the mood that had seized him and went on;\\r\\nbut as he passed the great white monolith he crossed himself, though he\\r\\nwas not a Catholic. He wondered what had impelled him to the unfamiliar\\r\\nact, but he could no more explain it than he could the strange and\\r\\nuncanny suggestion of power and personality that seemed to surround the\\r\\ncrumbling cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother turn in the path and the trail narrowed where it passed between\\r\\ntwo huge boulders that might have fallen from the cliff top towering\\r\\nfar above. Cliffs closed in closely now in front and upon two sides.\\r\\nApparently he was close to the canyon\\'s head and yet there was no\\r\\nslightest indication of a village. Yet where did the trail lead? It had\\r\\nan end and a purpose. He would discover the former and, if possible,\\r\\nthe latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill under the depressing influence of the cross, Blake passed between\\r\\nthe two boulders; and the instant that he had passed them a man stepped\\r\\nout behind him and another in front. They were negroes, stalwart,\\r\\nfine-featured fellows, and in themselves nothing to arouse wonder or\\r\\nsurprise. Blake had expected to meet negroes in Africa; but not negroes\\r\\nwearing elaborately decorated leathern jerkins upon the breasts of\\r\\nwhich red crosses were emblazoned, close fitting nether garments and\\r\\nsandals held by doeskin thongs, cross gartered half way to their knees;\\r\\nnot negroes wearing close fitting bassinets of leopard skin that fitted\\r\\ntheir heads closely and reached to below their ears; not negroes armed\\r\\nwith two handed broad swords and elaborately tipped pikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was acutely aware of the pike tips as there was one pressing\\r\\nagainst his belly and another in the small of his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who be ye?\" demanded the negro that faced Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the man addressed him in Greek Blake would have been no more\\r\\nsurprised than he was by the incongruity of this archaic form of speech\\r\\nfalling from the lips of a twentieth century central African black. He\\r\\nwas too dumbfounded for an instant to reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Doubtless the fellow be a Saracen, Paul!\" said the black behind Blake,\\r\\n\"and understands not what thou sayest--a spy, perchance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Peter Wiggs, as my name be Paul Bodkin he be no infidel--that I\\r\\nknow of mine own good eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatsoe\\'er he be it is for ye to fetch him before the captain of the\\r\\ngate who will question him, Paul Bodkin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Natheless there be no hurt in questioning him first, an he will\\r\\nanswer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop thy tongue and take him to the captain,\" said Peter. \"I will\\r\\nabide here and guard the way until thou returnest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul stepped aside and motioned for Blake to precede him. Then he fell\\r\\nin behind and the American did not need to glance back to know that the\\r\\nornate tip of the pike was ever threateningly ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way lay plain before him and Blake followed the trail toward the\\r\\ncliffs where there presently appeared the black mouth of a tunnel\\r\\nleading straight into the rocky escarpment. Leaning against the sides\\r\\nof a niche just within the entrance were several torches made of reeds\\r\\nor twigs bound tightly together and dipped in pitch. One of these\\r\\nPaul Bodkin selected, took some tinder from a metal box he carried in\\r\\na pouch at his side, struck a spark to it with flint and steel; and\\r\\nhaving thus ignited the tinder and lighted the torch he pushed Blake on\\r\\nagain with the tip of his pike and the two entered the tunnel, which\\r\\nthe American found to be narrow and winding, well suited to defense.\\r\\nIts floor was worn smooth until the stones of which it was composed\\r\\nshone polished in the flaring of the torch. The sides and roof were\\r\\nblack with the soot of countless thousands, perhaps, of torch-lighted\\r\\npassages along this strange way that led to--what?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _The Snake Strikes_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnversed in jungle craft, overwhelmed by the enormity of the\\r\\ncatastrophe that had engulfed him, his reasoning faculties numbed by\\r\\nterror, Wilbur Stimbol slunk through the jungle, the fleeing quarry of\\r\\nevery terror that imagination could conjure. Matted filth caked the\\r\\ntattered remnants of his clothing that scarce covered the filth of his\\r\\nemaciated body. His once graying hair had turned to white, matching the\\r\\nwhite stubble of a four days\\' beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed a broad and well marked trail along which men and horses,\\r\\nsheep and goats had passed within the week, and with the blindness\\r\\nand ignorance of the city dweller he thought that he was on the spoor\\r\\nof Blake\\'s safari. Thus it came that he stumbled, exhausted, into the\\r\\nmenzil of the slow moving Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nFejjuan, the Galla slave, discovered him and took him at once to the\\r\\nsheik\\'s beyt where Ibn Jad, with his brother, Tollog, and several\\r\\nothers were squatting in the mukaad sipping coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah! What strange creature hast thou captured now, Fejjuan?\"\\r\\ndemanded the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps a holy man,\" replied the black, \"for he is very poor and\\r\\nwithout weapons and very dirty--yes, surely he must be a very holy man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who art thou?\" demanded Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am lost and starving. Give me food,\" begged Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut neither understood the language of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another Nasrany,\" said Fahd, contemptuously. \"A Frenjy, perhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looks more like one of el-Engleys,\" remarked Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he is from Fransa,\" suggested Ibn Jad. \"Speak to him that vile\\r\\ntongue, Fahd, which thou didst come by among the soldiers in Algeria.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are you, stranger?\" demanded Fahd, in French.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an American,\" replied Stimbol, relieved and delighted to have\\r\\ndiscovered a medium of communication with the Arabs. \"I have been lost\\r\\nin the jungle and I am starving.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is from the New World and he has been lost and is starving,\"\\r\\ntranslated Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad directed that food be brought, and as the stranger ate they\\r\\ncarried on a conversation through Fahd. Stimbol explained that his men\\r\\nhad deserted him and that he would pay well to be taken to the coast.\\r\\nThe Beduin had no desire to be further hampered by the presence of\\r\\na weak old man and was inclined to have Stimbol\\'s throat slit as the\\r\\neasiest solution of the problem, but Fahd, who was impressed by the\\r\\nman\\'s boastings of his great wealth, saw the possibilities of a large\\r\\nreward or ransom and prevailed upon the sheik to permit Stimbol to\\r\\nremain among them for a time at least, promising to take him into his\\r\\nown beyt and be responsible for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ibn Jad would have slain you, Nasrany,\" said Fahd to Stimbol later,\\r\\n\"but Fahd saved you. Remember that when the time comes for distributing\\r\\nthe reward and remember, too, that Ibn Jad will be as ready to kill you\\r\\ntomorrow as he was today and that always your life is in the hands of\\r\\nFahd. What is it worth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make you rich,\" replied Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the days that followed, Fahd and Stimbol became much better\\r\\nacquainted and with returning strength and a feeling of security\\r\\nStimbol\\'s old boastfulness returned. He succeeded in impressing the\\r\\nyoung Beduin with his vast wealth and importance, and so lavish\\r\\nwere his promises that Fahd soon commenced to see before him a life\\r\\nof luxury, ease and power; but with growing cupidity and ambition\\r\\ndeveloped an increasing fear that someone might wrest his good fortune\\r\\nfrom him. Ibn Jad being the most logical and powerful competitor for\\r\\nthe favors of the Nasrany, Fahd lost no opportunity to impress upon\\r\\nStimbol that the sheik was still thirsting for his blood; though, as\\r\\na matter of fact, Ibn Jad was so little concerned over the affairs of\\r\\nWilbur Stimbol that he would have forgotten his presence entirely were\\r\\nhe not occasionally reminded of it by seeing the man upon the march or\\r\\nabout the camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing, however, that Fahd accomplished was to acquaint Stimbol\\r\\nwith the fact that there was dissension and treachery in the ranks of\\r\\nthe Beduins and this he determined to use to his own advantage should\\r\\nnecessity demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ever, though slowly, the \\'Aarab drew closer to the fabled Leopard\\r\\nCity of Nimmr, and as they marched Zeyd found opportunity to forward\\r\\nhis suit for the hand of Ateja the daughter of Sheik Ibn Jad, while\\r\\nTollog sought by insinuation to advance the claims of Fahd in the eyes\\r\\nof the sheik. This he did always and only when Fahd might hear as, in\\r\\nreality, his only wish was to impress upon the young traitor the depth\\r\\nof the latter\\'s obligation to him. When Tollog should become sheik he\\r\\nwould not care who won the hand of Ateja.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fahd was not satisfied with the progress that was being made.\\r\\nJealousy rode him to distraction until he could not look upon Zeyd\\r\\nwithout thoughts of murder seizing his mind; at last they obsessed\\r\\nhim. He schemed continually to rid himself and the world of his more\\r\\nsuccessful rival. He spied upon him and upon Ateja, and at last a plan\\r\\nunfolded itself with opportunity treading upon its heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd had noticed that nightly Zeyd absented himself from the gatherings\\r\\nof the men in the mukaad of the sheik\\'s tent and that when the simple\\r\\nhousehold duties were performed Ateja slipped out into the night. Fahd\\r\\nfollowed and confirmed what was really too apparent to be dignified by\\r\\nthe name of suspicion--Zeyd and Ateja met.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then one night, Fahd was not at the meeting in the sheik\\'s beyt.\\r\\nInstead he hid near the tent of Zeyd, and when the latter had left to\\r\\nkeep his tryst Fahd crept in and seized the matchlock of his rival. It\\r\\nwas already loaded and he had but to prime it with powder. Stealthily\\r\\nhe crept by back ways through the camp to where Zeyd awaited his light\\r\\nof love and sneaked up behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a little distance, sitting in his mukaad with his friends beneath\\r\\nthe light of paper lanterns, Ibn Jad the sheik was plainly visible to\\r\\nthe two young men standing in the outer darkness. Ateja was still in\\r\\nthe women\\'s quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd, standing behind Zeyd, raised the ancient matchlock to his\\r\\nshoulder and aimed--very carefully he aimed, but not at Zeyd. No,\\r\\nfor the cunning of Fahd was as the cunning of the fox. Had Zeyd been\\r\\nmurdered naught could ever convince Ateja that Fahd was not the\\r\\nmurderer. Fahd knew that, and he was equally sure that Ateja would\\r\\nhave naught of the slayer of her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond Zeyd was Ibn Jad, but Fahd was not aiming at Ibn Jad either.\\r\\nAt whom was he aiming? No one. Not yet was the time ripe to slay the\\r\\nsheik. First must they have their hands upon the treasure, the secret\\r\\nof which he alone was supposed to hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd aimed at one of the am\\'dan of the sheik\\'s tent. He aimed with\\r\\ngreat care and then he pulled the trigger. The prop splintered and\\r\\nbroke a foot above the level of Ibn Jad\\'s head, and simultaneously Fahd\\r\\nthrew down the musket and leaped upon the startled Zeyd, at the same\\r\\ntime crying loudly for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nStartled by the shot and the cries, men ran from all directions and\\r\\nwith them was the sheik. He found Zeyd being held tightly from behind\\r\\nby Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" demanded Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, Ibn Jad, he would have slain thee!\" cried Fahd. \"I came upon\\r\\nhim just in time, and as he fired I leaped upon his back, else he would\\r\\nhave killed you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lies!\" cried Zeyd. \"The shot came from behind me. If any fired upon\\r\\nIbn Jad it was Fahd himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja, wide-eyed, ran to her lover. \"Thou didst not do it, Zeyd; tell\\r\\nme that thou didst not do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As Allah is my God and Mohammed his prophet I did not do it,\" swore\\r\\nZeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not have thought it of him,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nCunning, Fahd did not mention the matchlock. Shrewdly he guessed that\\r\\nits evidence would be more potent if discovered by another than he, and\\r\\nthat it would be discovered he was sure. Nor was he wrong. Tollog found\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" he exclaimed, \"is the weapon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us examine it beneath the light,\" said Ibn Jad. \"It should dispel\\r\\nour doubts more surely than any lying tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the party moved in the direction of the sheik\\'s beyt Zeyd\\r\\nexperienced the relief of one reprieved from death, for he knew that\\r\\nthe testimony of the matchlock would exonerate him. It could not be\\r\\nhis. He pressed the hand of Ateja, walking at his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath the light of the paper lanterns in the mukaad Ibn Jad held the\\r\\nweapon beneath his gaze as, with craning necks, the others pressed\\r\\nabout him. A single glance sufficed. With stern visage the sheik raised\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Zeyd\\'s,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja gasped and drew away from her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not do it! It is some trick,\" cried Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take him away!\" commanded Ibn Jad. \"See that he is tightly bound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja rushed to her father and fell upon her knees. \"Do not slay him!\"\\r\\nshe cried. \"It could not have been he. I know it was not he.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Silence, girl!\" commanded the sheik sternly. \"Go to thy quarters and\\r\\nremain there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took Zeyd to his own beyt and bound him securely, and in the\\r\\nmukaad of the sheik the elders sat in judgment while from behind the\\r\\ncurtains of the women\\'s quarters, Ateja listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At dawn, then, he shall be shot!\" This was the sentence that Ateja\\r\\nheard passed upon her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind his greasy thorrib Fahd smiled a crooked smile. In his black\\r\\nhouse of hair Zeyd struggled with the bonds that held him, for though\\r\\nhe had not heard the sentence he was aware of what his fate would be.\\r\\nIn the quarters of the hareem of the Sheik Ibn Jad the sheik\\'s daughter\\r\\nlay sleepless and suffering. Her long lashes were wet with tears but\\r\\nher grief was silent. Wide-eyed she waited, listening, and presently\\r\\nher patience was rewarded by the sounds of the deep, regular breathing\\r\\nof Ibn Jad and his wife, Hirfa. They slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja stirred. Stealthily she raised the lower edge of the tent cloth\\r\\nbeside which lay her sleeping mat and rolled quietly beneath it into\\r\\nthe mukaad, now deserted. Groping, she found the matchlock of Zeyd\\r\\nwhere Ibn Jad had left it. She carried also a bundle wrapped in an old\\r\\nthorrib, the contents of which she had gathered earlier in the evening\\r\\nwhen Hirfa, occupied with her duties, had been temporarily absent from\\r\\nthe women\\'s quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja emerged from the tent of her father and crept cautiously along\\r\\nthe single, irregular street formed by the pitched tents of the \\'Aarab\\r\\nuntil she came to the beyt of Zeyd. For a moment she paused at the\\r\\nopening, listening, then she entered softly on sandalled feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Zeyd, sleepless, struggling with his bonds, heard her. \"Who comes?\"\\r\\nhe demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"S-s-sh!\" cautioned the girl. \"It is I, Ateja.\" She crept to his side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beloved!\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeftly the girl cut the bonds that held his wrists and ankles. \"I have\\r\\nbrought thee food and thy musket,\" she told him. \"These and freedom I\\r\\ngive thee--the rest thou must do thyself. Thy mare stands tethered with\\r\\nthe others. Far is the beled el-Guad, beset with dangers is the way,\\r\\nbut night and day will Ateja pray to Allah to guide thee safely. Haste,\\r\\nmy loved one!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZeyd pressed her tightly to his breast, kissed her and was gone into\\r\\nthe night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n                             _Sir Richard_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor of the tunnel along which Paul Bodkin conducted Blake\\r\\ninclined ever upwards, and again and again it was broken by flights\\r\\nof steps which carried them always to higher levels. To Blake the way\\r\\nseemed interminable. Even the haunting mystery of the long tunnel\\r\\nfailed to overcome the monotony of its unchanging walls that slipped\\r\\nsilently into the torch\\'s dim ken for a brief instant and as silently\\r\\nback into the Cimmerian oblivion behind to make place for more wall\\r\\nunvaryingly identical.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as there ever is to all things, there was an end to the tunnel.\\r\\nBlake first glimpsed it in a little patch of distant daylight ahead,\\r\\nand presently he stepped out into the sunlight and looked out across\\r\\na wide valley that was tree-dotted and beautiful. He found himself\\r\\nstanding upon a wide ledge, or shelf, some hundred feet above the base\\r\\nof the mountain through which the tunnel had been cut. There was a\\r\\nsheer drop before him, and to his right the ledge terminated abruptly\\r\\nat a distance of a hundred feet or less. Then he glanced to the left\\r\\nand his eyes went wide in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the shelf stood a solid wall of masonry flanked at either side\\r\\nby great, round towers pierced by long, narrow embrasures. In the\\r\\ncenter of the wall was a lofty gateway which was closed by a massive\\r\\nand handsomely wrought portcullis behind which Blake saw two negroes\\r\\nstanding guard. They were clothed precisely as his captors, but held\\r\\ngreat battle-axes, the butts of which rested upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What ho, the gate!\" shouted Paul Bodkin. \"Open to the outer guard and\\r\\na prisoner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly the portcullis rose and Blake and his captor passed beneath.\\r\\nDirectly inside the gateway and at the left, built into the hillside,\\r\\nwas what was evidently a guardhouse. Before it loitered a score\\r\\nor so of soldiers, uniformed like Paul Bodkin, upon the breast of\\r\\neach the red cross. To a heavy wooden rail gaily caparisoned horses\\r\\nwere tethered, their handsome trappings recalling to Blake\\'s memory\\r\\npaintings he had seen of mounted knights of medieval England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was so much of unreality in the strangely garbed blacks, the\\r\\nmassive barbican that guarded the way, the trappings of the horses,\\r\\nthat Blake was no longer capable of surprise when one of the two doors\\r\\nin the guardhouse opened and there stepped out a handsome young man\\r\\nclad in a hauberk of chain mail over which was a light surcoat of\\r\\nrough stuff, dyed purple. Upon the youth\\'s head fitted a leopard skin\\r\\nbassinet from the lower edge of which depended a camail or gorget of\\r\\nchain mail that entirely surrounded and protected his throat and neck.\\r\\nHe was armed only with a heavy sword and a dagger, but against the\\r\\nside of the guardhouse, near the doorway where he paused to look at\\r\\nBlake, leaned a long lance, and near it was a shield with a red cross\\r\\nemblazoned upon its boss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Od zounds!\" exclaimed the young man. \"What hast thou there, varlet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A prisoner, an\\' it pleases thee, noble lord,\" replied Paul Bodkin,\\r\\ndeferentially.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A Saracen, of a surety,\" stated the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, an I may make so bold, Sir Richard,\" replied Paul--\"but methinks\\r\\nhe be no Saracen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With mine own eyes I didst see him make the sign before the Cross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fetch him hither, lout!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBodkin prodded Blake in the rear with his pike, but the American scarce\\r\\nnoticed the offense so occupied was his mind by the light of truth\\r\\nthat had so suddenly illuminated it. In the instant he had grasped the\\r\\nsolution. He laughed inwardly at himself for his denseness. Now he\\r\\nunderstood everything--and these fellows thought they could put it\\r\\nover on him, did they? Well, they had come near to doing it, all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped quickly toward the young man and halted, upon his lips a\\r\\nfaintly sarcastic smile. The other eyed him with haughty arrogance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whence comest thou,\" he asked, \"and what doest thou in the Valley of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher, varlet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake\\'s smile faded--too much was too much. \"Cut the comedy, young\\r\\nfellow,\" he drawled in his slow way. \"Where\\'s the director?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Director? Forsooth, I know not what thou meanest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes you don\\'t!\" snapped Blake, with fine sarcasm. \"But let me tell you\\r\\nright off the bat that no seven-fifty a day extra can pull anything\\r\\nlike that with me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Od\\'s blud, fellow! I ken not the meaning of all the words, but I\\r\\nmislike thy tone. It savors o\\'er much of insult to fall sweetly upon\\r\\nthe ears of Richard Montmorency.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be yourself,\" advised Blake. \"If the director isn\\'t handy send for the\\r\\nassistant director, or the camera man--even the continuity writer may\\r\\nhave more sense than you seem to have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be myself? And who thinkest thee I would be other than Richard\\r\\nMontmorency, a noble knight of Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake shook his head in despair, then he turned to the soldiers who\\r\\nwere standing about listening to the conversation. He thought some of\\r\\nthem would be grinning at the joke that was being played on him, but he\\r\\nsaw only solemn, serious faces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" he said, addressing Paul Bodkin, \"don\\'t any of you know\\r\\nwhere the director is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Director\\'?\" repeated Bodkin, shaking his head. \"There be none in\\r\\nNimmr thus y-clept, nay, nor in all the Valley of the Sepulcher that I\\r\\nwot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" said Blake, \"the mistake is mine; but if there is no\\r\\ndirector there must be a keeper. May I see him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, keeper!\" cried Bodkin, his face lighting with understanding. \"Sir\\r\\nRichard is the keeper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My gawd!\" exclaimed Blake, turning to the young man. \"I beg your\\r\\npardon, I thought that you were one of the inmates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Inmates? Indeed thou speakest a strange tongue and yet withall it hath\\r\\nthe flavor of England,\" replied the young man gravely. \"But yon varlet\\r\\nbe right--I am indeed this day the Keeper of the Gate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was commencing to doubt his own sanity, or at least his judgment.\\r\\nNeither the young white man nor any of the negroes had any of the\\r\\nfacial characteristics of mad men. He looked up suddenly at the keeper\\r\\nof the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry,\" he said, flashing one of the frank smiles that was famous\\r\\namongst his acquaintances. \"I have acted like a boor, but I\\'ve been\\r\\nunder considerable of a nervous strain for a long time, and on top of\\r\\nthat I\\'ve been lost in the jungle for days without proper or sufficient\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought that you were trying to play some sort of a joke on me and,\\r\\nwell, I wasn\\'t in any mood for jokes when I expected friendship and\\r\\nhospitality instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me, where am I? What country is this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art close upon the city of Nimmr,\" replied the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose this is something of a national holiday or something?\"\\r\\nsuggested Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not understand thee,\" replied the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you\\'re all in a pageant or something, aren\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Od\\'s bodikins! the fellow speaks an outlandish tongue! Pageant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, those costumes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What be amiss with this apparel? True, \\'tis not of any wondrous\\r\\nnewness, but methinks it be at least more fair than thine. At least it\\r\\nwell suffices the daily service of a knight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean that you dress like this every day?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why not? But enough of this. I have no wish to further bandy words\\r\\nwith thee. Fetch him within, two of thee. And thou, Bodkin, return to\\r\\nthe outer guard!\" The young man turned and reentered the building,\\r\\nwhile two of the soldiers seized Blake, none too gently, and hustled\\r\\nhim within.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found himself in a high-ceiled room with walls of cut stone and\\r\\ngreat, hand-hewn beams and rafters blackened with age. Upon the stone\\r\\nfloor stood a table behind which, upon a bench, the young man seated\\r\\nhimself while Blake was placed facing him with a guard on either hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy name,\" demanded the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That be all--just Blake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"James Hunter Blake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What title bearest thou in thine own country?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no title.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, thou art not a gentleman, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am called one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is thy country?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"America.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"America! There is no such country, fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard of it. What doest thou near the Valley of the Sepulcher?\\r\\nDidst not know \\'tis forbidden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you I was lost. I didn\\'t know where I was. All I want is to get\\r\\nback to my safari or to the coast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That be impossible. We be surrounded by Saracens. For seven hundred\\r\\nand thirty-five years we have been invested by their armies. How come\\r\\nyou through the enemies\\' lines? How passed you through his vast army?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There isn\\'t any army.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Givest thou the lie to Richard Montmorency, varlet? An\\' thou wert of\\r\\ngentle blood thou shouldst account to me that insult upon the field\\r\\nof honor. Methink\\'st thou beest some lowborn spy sent hither by the\\r\\nSaracen sultan. \\'Twould be well an thou confessed all to me, for if I\\r\\ntake thee before the Prince he will wrest the truth from thee in ways\\r\\nthat are far from pleasant. What say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing to confess. Take me before the Prince, or whoever your\\r\\nboss is; perhaps he will at least give me food.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shalt have food here. Never shall it be said that Richard\\r\\nMontmorency turned a hungry man from his doorway. Hey! Michel! Michel!\\r\\nWhere is the lazy brat? Michel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA door opened from an inner apartment to admit a boy, sleepy eyed,\\r\\ndigging a grimy fist into one eye. He was clothed in a short tunic, his\\r\\nlegs encased in green tights. In his cap was a feather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sleeping again, eh?\" demanded Sir Richard. \"Thou lazy knave! Fetch\\r\\nbread and meat for this poor wayfarer and be not until the morrow at\\r\\nit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWide-eyed and rather stupidly, the boy stared at Blake. \"A Saracen,\\r\\nmaster?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What boots it?\" snapped Sir Richard. \"Did not our Lord Jesus feed the\\r\\nmultitude, nor ask if there were unbelievers among them? Haste, churl!\\r\\nThe stranger be of great hunger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth turned and shuffled from the room, wiping his nose upon his\\r\\nsleeve, and Sir Richard\\'s attention came back to Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou are not ill-favored, fellow,\" he said. \"\\'Tis a pity that thou\\r\\nbeest not of noble blood, for thy mien appearth not like that of one\\r\\nlowborn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never considered myself lowborn,\" said Blake, with a grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy father, now--was he not at least a sir knight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was thinking quickly now. He was far from being able as yet to so\\r\\nmuch as hazard a guess that might explain his host\\'s archaic costume\\r\\nand language, but he was sure that the man was in earnest, whether sane\\r\\nor not, and were he not sane it seemed doubly wise to humor him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he replied, \"my father is a thirty second degree Mason\\r\\nand a Knight Templar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sblud! I knew it,\" cried Sir Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so am I,\" added Blake, when he realized the happy effect his\\r\\nstatement had produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, I knew it! I knew it!\" cried Sir Richard. \"Thy bearing proclaimed\\r\\nthy noble blood; but why didst thou seek to deceive me? And so thou art\\r\\none of the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon who\\r\\nguard the way of the pilgrims to the Holy Land! This explaineth thy\\r\\npoor raiment and glorifies it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was mystified by the allusion, as the picture always suggested\\r\\nby a reference to Knights Templar was of waving white plumes, gorgeous\\r\\naprons and glittering swords. He did not know that in the days of their\\r\\norigin they were clothed in any old garments that the charity of others\\r\\nmight bequeath them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Michel returned bearing a wooden trencher containing\\r\\ncold mutton and several pieces of simnel bread and carrying in one hand\\r\\na flagon of wine. These he set upon the table before Blake and going to\\r\\na cupboard fetched two metal goblets into which he decanted a portion\\r\\nof the contents of the flagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard arose and taking one of the goblets raised it before him on\\r\\na level with his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hal, Sir James!\" he cried, \"and welcome to Nimmr and the Valley of the\\r\\nSepulcher!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s looking at you!\" replied Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quaint saying,\" remarked Sir Richard. \"Methinks the ways of England\\r\\nmust be changed since the days of Richard the Lion Hearted when my\\r\\nnoble ancestor set forth upon the great crusade in the company of his\\r\\nking. Here\\'s looking at you! Ods bodikins! I must not let that from my\\r\\nmemory. Here\\'s looking at you! Just wait thou \\'til some fair knight\\r\\ndoth drink my health--I shall lay him flat with that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, stay! Here, Michel, fetch yon stool for Sir James, and eat, sir\\r\\nknight. Thou must be passing hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell the world I am,\" replied Blake, feelingly, as he sat down\\r\\non the stool that Michel brought. There were no knives or forks, but\\r\\nthere were fingers and these Blake used to advantage while his host sat\\r\\nsmiling happily at him from across the rude table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art better than a minstrel for pleasure,\" cried Sir Richard.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell the world I am! Ho, ho! Thou wilt be a gift from heaven in\\r\\nthe castle of the prince. I\\'ll tell the world I am!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Blake had satisfied his hunger, Sir Richard ordered Michel to\\r\\nprepare horses. \"We ride down to the castle, Sir James,\" he explained.\\r\\n\"No longer art thou my prisoner, but my friend and guest. That I should\\r\\nhave received thee so scurvily shalt ever be to my discredit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMounted upon prancing chargers and followed at a respectful distance by\\r\\nMichel, the two rode down the winding mountain road. Sir Richard now\\r\\ncarried his shield and lance, a pennon fluttering bravely in the wind\\r\\nfrom just below the tip of the latter, the sun glancing from the metal\\r\\nof his hauberk, a smile upon his brave face as he chatted with his\\r\\nerstwhile prisoner. To Blake he seemed a gorgeous picture ridden from\\r\\nout the pages of a story book. Yet, belying his martial appearance,\\r\\nthere was a childlike simplicity about the man that won Blake\\'s liking\\r\\nfrom the first, for there was that about him that made it impossible\\r\\nfor one to conceive him as the perpetrator of a dishonorable act.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis ready acceptance of Blake\\'s statements about himself bespoke a\\r\\ncredulity that seemed incompatible with the high intelligence reflected\\r\\nby his noble countenance, and the American preferred to attribute it to\\r\\na combination of unsophistication and an innate integrity which could\\r\\nnot conceive of perfidy in others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the road rounded the shoulder of a hill, Blake saw another barbican\\r\\nbarring the way and, beyond, the towers and battlements of an ancient\\r\\ncastle. At a command from Sir Richard the warders of the gate opened to\\r\\nthem and the three rode through into the ballium. This space between\\r\\nthe outer and inner walls appeared unkept and neglected. Several old\\r\\ntrees flourished within it and beneath the shade of one of these, close\\r\\nto the outer gateway, lolled several men-at-arms, two of whom were\\r\\nengaged in a game that resembled draughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foot of the inner wall was a wide moat, the waters of which\\r\\nreflected the gray stones of the wall and the ancient vines that,\\r\\ngrowing upon its inner side, topped it to form a leafy coping that\\r\\noccasionally hung low upon the outer side.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly opposite the barbican was the great gateway in the inner wall\\r\\nand here a drawbridge spanned the moat and a heavy portcullis barred\\r\\nthe way into the great court of the castle; but at a word from Sir\\r\\nRichard the gate lifted and, clattering across the drawbridge, they\\r\\nrode within.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Blake\\'s astonished eyes loomed a mighty castle of rough hewn\\r\\nstone, while to the right and left, within the great court, spread\\r\\nbroad gardens not illy kept, in which were gathered a company of men\\r\\nand women who might have just stepped from Arthur\\'s court.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sight of Sir Richard and his companion the nearer members of the\\r\\ncompany regarded Blake with interest and evident surprise. Several\\r\\ncalled greetings and questions to Sir Richard as the two men dismounted\\r\\nand turned their horses over to Michel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho, Richard!\" cried one. \"What bringest thou--a Saracen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" replied Richard. \"A fair sir knight who would do his devoir to\\r\\nthe prince. Where be he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yonder,\" and they pointed toward the far end of the court where a\\r\\nlarge company was assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Sir James!\" directed Richard, and led him down the courtyard,\\r\\nthe knights and ladies following closely, asking questions, commenting\\r\\nwith a frankness that brought a flush to Blake\\'s face. The women\\r\\nopenly praised his features and his carriage while the men, perhaps\\r\\nprompted by jealousy, made unflattering remarks about his soiled and\\r\\ntorn apparel and its, to them, ridiculous cut; and indeed the contrast\\r\\nwas great between their gorgeous dalmaticas of villosa or cyclas,\\r\\ntheir close-fitting tights, their colored caps and Blake\\'s drab shirt,\\r\\nwhip-cord breeches and cordovan boots, now soiled, torn and scratched.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women were quite as richly dressed as the men, wearing clinging\\r\\nmantles of rich stuff, their hair and shoulders covered with dainty\\r\\nwimples of various colors and often elaborately embroidered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of these men, nor any of those in the assemblage they were\\r\\napproaching, wore armor, but Blake had seen an armored knight at the\\r\\nouter gateway and another at the inner and he judged that only when\\r\\nengaged in military duties did they wear this heavy and uncomfortable\\r\\ndress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the party at the end of the court Sir Richard elbowed\\r\\nhis way among them to the center of the group where stood a tall man of\\r\\nimposing appearance, chatting with those about him. As Sir Richard and\\r\\nBlake halted before him the company fell silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My lord prince,\" said Richard, bowing, \"I bring thee Sir James, a\\r\\nworthy Knight Templar who hath come under the protection of God through\\r\\nthe lines of the enemy to the gates of Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tall man eyed Blake searchingly and he had not the appearance of\\r\\ngreat credulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou sayest that thou comest from the Temple of Solomon in the\\r\\nKingdom of Jerusalem?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Richard must have misunderstood me,\" replied Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then thou art no Knight Templar?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I am not from Jerusalem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perchance he is one of those doughty sir knights that guard the\\r\\npilgrims\\' way to the Holy Land,\" suggested a young woman standing near\\r\\nthe prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake glanced quickly at the speaker and as their eyes met, hers fell,\\r\\nbut not before he had seen that they were very beautiful eyes set in an\\r\\nequally beautiful, oval face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More like it haps he be a Saracen spy sent among us by the sultan,\"\\r\\nsnapped a dark man who stood beside the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter raised her eyes to the prince. \"He looketh not like a\\r\\nSaracen, my father,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What knowest thou of the appearance of a Saracen, child?\" demanded the\\r\\nprince. \"Hast seen so many?\" The party laughed and the girl pouted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Verily an\\' I hast seen full as many a Saracen as has Sir Malud or\\r\\nthyself, my lord prince,\" she snapped, haughtily. \"Let Sir Malud\\r\\ndescribe a Saracen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark young man flushed angrily. \"At least,\" he said, \"my lord\\r\\nprince, I knowest an English knight when I seest one, an\\' if here be an\\r\\nEnglish knight then Sir Malud be a Saracen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough,\" said the prince and then, turning to Blake: \"If thou art not\\r\\nfrom Jerusalem where art thou from?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"New York,\" replied the American.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha,\" whispered Sir Malud to the girl, \"didst I not tell you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me what--that he is from New York? Where is that?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some stronghold of the infidel,\" asserted Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"New York?\" repeated the prince. \"Be that in the Holy Land?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is sometimes called New Jerusalem,\" explained Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thou comest to Nimmr through the lines of the enemy? Tell me, sir\\r\\nknight, had they many men-at-arms? And how were their forces disposed?\\r\\nBe they close upon the Valley of the Sepulcher? Thinkest thou they plan\\r\\nan early attack? Come, tell me all--thou canst be of great service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come for days through the forest and seen no living man,\" said\\r\\nBlake. \"No enemy surrounds you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didst I not tell thee?\" demanded Malud. \"He is an enemy spy. He\\r\\nwouldst lead us into the belief that we are safe that the forces of the\\r\\nsultan may find us off our guard and take Nimmr and the Valley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ods blud! Methinks thou beest right, Sir Malud,\" cried the prince. \"No\\r\\nenemy indeed! Why else then hast the knights of Nimmr lain here seven\\r\\nand a half centuries if there be no horde of infidels surrounding our\\r\\nstronghold?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Search me,\" said Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh, what?\" demanded the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hath a quaint manner of speech, my lord prince,\" explained Richard,\\r\\n\"but I do not think him an enemy of England. Myself will vouch for him\\r\\nan\\' you will take him into your service, my lord prince.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wouldst enter my service, sir?\" demanded the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake glanced at Sir Malud and looked dubious--then his eyes wandered\\r\\nto those of the girl. \"I\\'ll tell the world I would!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n                         _The Return of Ulala_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNuma was hungry. For three days and three nights he had hunted but\\r\\nalways the prey had eluded him. Perhaps Numa was growing old. Not so\\r\\nkeen were his scent and his vision, not so swift his charges, nor well\\r\\ntimed the spring that heretofore had brought down the quarry. So quick\\r\\nthe food of Numa that a fraction of a second, a hair\\'s breadth, might\\r\\nmark the difference between a full belly and starvation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Numa was growing old, yet he still was a mighty engine of\\r\\ndestruction, and now the pangs of hunger had increased his ferocity\\r\\nmany-fold, stimulated his cunning, emboldened him to take great risks\\r\\nthat his belly might be filled. It was a nervous, irascible, ferocious\\r\\nNuma that crouched beside the trail. His up-pricked ears, his intent\\r\\nand blazing eyes, his quivering nostrils, the gently moving tail-tip,\\r\\nevidenced his awareness of another presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the wind to the nostrils of Numa the lion came the man-scent.\\r\\nFour days ago, his belly full, Numa had doubtless slunk away at the\\r\\nfirst indication of the presence of man, but today is another day and\\r\\nanother Numa.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeyd, three days upon the back track from the menzil of the sheik Ibn\\r\\nJad, thought of Ateja, of far Guad, congratulated himself upon the good\\r\\nfortune that had thus far smiled upon his escape and flight. His mare\\r\\nmoved slowly along the jungle trail, unurged, for the way was long; and\\r\\njust ahead a beast of prey waited in ambush.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Numa\\'s were not the only ears to hear, nor his nostrils the only\\r\\nnostrils to scent the coming of the man-thing--another beast crouched\\r\\nnear, unknown to Numa.\\r\\n\\r\\nOveranxious, fearful of being cheated of his meat, Numa made a false\\r\\nmove. Down the trail came the mare. She must pass within a yard of\\r\\nNuma, but Numa could not wait. Before she was within the radius of\\r\\nhis spring he charged, voicing a horrid roar. Terrified the mare\\r\\nreared and, rearing, tried to turn and bolt. Overbalanced, she toppled\\r\\nbackward and fell, and in falling unhorsed Zeyd; but in the instant she\\r\\nwas up and flying back along the trail, leaving her master in the path\\r\\nof the charging lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorrified, the man saw the snarling face, the bared fangs almost upon\\r\\nhim. Then he saw something else--something equally awe-inspiring--a\\r\\nnaked giant who leaped from a swaying branch full upon the back of the\\r\\ngreat cat. He saw a bronzed arm encircle the neck of the beast of prey\\r\\nas the lion was borne to earth by the weight and impact of the man\\'s\\r\\nbody. He saw a heavy knife flashing in the air, striking home again\\r\\nand again as the frenzied lion threw itself about in futile effort to\\r\\ndislodge the thing upon its back. He heard the roars and the growls of\\r\\nel-adrea, and mingled with them were growls and snarls that turned his\\r\\nblood cold, for he saw that they came from the lips of the man-beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Numa went limp and the giant arose and stood above the carcass.\\r\\nHe placed one foot upon it and, raising his face toward the heavens,\\r\\nvoiced a hideous scream that froze the marrow in the bones of the\\r\\nBeduin--a scream that few men have heard: the victory cry of the bull\\r\\nape.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that Zeyd recognized his saviour and shuddered again as he\\r\\nsaw that it was Tarzan of the Apes. The ape-man looked down at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art from the menzil of Ibn Jad,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am but a poor man,\" replied Zeyd. \"I but followed where my sheykh\\r\\nled. Hold it not against Zeyd sheykh of the jungle, that he be in thy\\r\\nbeled. Spare my poor life I pray thee and may Allah bless thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no wish to harm thee, Beduwy,\" replied Tarzan. \"What wrong hath\\r\\nbeen done in my country is the fault of Ibn Jad alone. Is he close by?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah nay, he be many marches from here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where art thy companions?\" demanded the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan frowned. \"Think well Beduwy before lying to Tarzan,\" he snapped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, I speak the truth! I am alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fahd did plot against me to make it appear that I had tried to take\\r\\nthe life of Ibn Jad, which, before Allah, is a lie that stinketh to\\r\\nheaven, and I was to be shot; but Ateja, the daughter of the sheykh,\\r\\ncut my bonds in the night and I escaped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is thy name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zeyd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whither goest thou--to thine own country?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, to beled el-Guad, a Beny Salem fendy of el-Harb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou canst not, alone, survive the perils of the way,\" Tarzan warned\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of that I be fearful, but death were certain had I not escaped the\\r\\nwrath of Ibn Jad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Tarzan was silent in thought. \"Great must be the love of\\r\\nAteja, the daughter of the sheik, and great her belief in you,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, yes, great is our love and, too, she knew that I would not\\r\\nslay her father, whom she loves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan nodded. \"I believe thee and shall help thee. Thou canst not go\\r\\non alone. I shall take thee to the nearest village and there the chief\\r\\nwill furnish you with warriors who will take you to the next village,\\r\\nand thus from village to village you will be escorted to the Soudan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May Allah ever watch over and guard thee!\" exclaimed Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me,\" said Tarzan as the two moved along the jungle trail in the\\r\\ndirection of the nearest village which lay two marches to the south of\\r\\nthem, \"tell me what Ibn Jad doth in this country. It is not true that\\r\\nhe came for ivory alone. Am I not right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah yes, Sheykh Tarzan,\" admitted Zeyd. \"Ibn Jad came for treasure,\\r\\nbut not for ivory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In el-Habash lies the treasure city of Nimmr,\" explained Zeyd. \"This\\r\\nIbn Jad was told by a learned sahar. So great is the wealth of Nimmr\\r\\nthat a thousand camels could carry away not a tenth part of it. It\\r\\nconsists of gold and jewels and--a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A woman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a woman of such wondrous beauty that in the north she alone would\\r\\nbring a price that would make Ibn Jad rich beyond dreams. Surely thou\\r\\nmust have heard of Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes the Gallas speak of it,\" said Tarzan, \"but always I thought\\r\\nit of no more reality than the other places of their legends. And Ibn\\r\\nJad undertook this long and dangerous journey on no more than the word\\r\\nof a magician?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could be better than the word of a learned sahar?\" demanded Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes shrugged.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the two days that it took them to reach the village Tarzan\\r\\nlearned of the white man who had come to the camp of Ibn Jad, but from\\r\\nZeyd\\'s description of him he was not positive whether it was Blake or\\r\\nStimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tarzan travelled south with Zeyd, Ibn Jad trekked northward into\\r\\nel-Habash, and Fahd plotted with Tollog, and Stimbol plotted with Fahd,\\r\\nwhile Fejjuan the Galla slave waited patiently for the moment of his\\r\\ndelivery from bondage, and Ateja mourned for Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a boy thou wert raised in this country, Fejjuan,\" she said one day\\r\\nto the Galla slave. \"Tell me, dost thou think Zeyd could make his way\\r\\nalone to el-Guad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, nay,\" replied the black. \"Doubtless he be dead by now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl stifled a sob.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fejjuan mourns with thee, Ateja,\" said the black, \"for Zeyd was a\\r\\nkindly man. Would that Allah had spared your lover and taken him who\\r\\nwas guilty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Ateja. \"Knowest thou, Fejjuan, who fired the\\r\\nshot at Ibn Jad, my father? It was not Zeyd! Tell me it was not Zeyd!\\r\\nBut thy words tell me that, which I well knew before. Zeyd could not\\r\\nhave sought the life of my father!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor did he,\" replied Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me what you know of this thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will not tell another who told you?\" he asked. \"It would go\\r\\nhard with me if one I am thinking of knew that I had seen what I did\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I swear by Allah that I wilt not betray you, Fejjuan,\" cried the girl.\\r\\n\"Tell me, what didst thou see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not see who fired the shot at thy father, Ateja,\" replied the\\r\\nblack, \"but something else I saw before the shot was fired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, what was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw Fahd creep into the beyt of Zeyd and come out again bearing\\r\\nZeyd\\'s matchlock. That I saw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\" cried the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Ibn Jad will not believe if you tell him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know; but now that I am convinced perhaps I shall find a way to have\\r\\nFahd\\'s blood for the blood of Zeyd,\" cried the girl, bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor days Ibn Jad skirted the mountains behind which he thought lay the\\r\\nfabled city of Nimmr as he searched for an entrance which he hoped\\r\\nto find without having recourse to the natives whose haunts he had\\r\\nsedulously avoided lest through them opposition to his venture might\\r\\ndevelop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was sparsely settled, which rendered it easy for the \\'Aarab\\r\\nto avoid coming into close contact with the natives, though it was\\r\\nimpossible that the Gallas were ignorant of their presence. If however\\r\\nthe blacks were willing to leave them alone, Ibn Jad had no intention\\r\\nof molesting them unless he found that it would be impossible to carry\\r\\nhis project to a successful issue without their assistance, in which\\r\\nevent he was equally ready to approach them with false promises or\\r\\nruthless cruelty, whichever seemed the more likely to better serve his\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days passed Ibn Jad waxed increasingly impatient, for, search\\r\\nas he would, he could locate no pass across the mountains, nor any\\r\\nentrance to the fabled valley wherein lay the treasure city of Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah!\" he exclaimed one day, \"there be a City of Nimmr and there be\\r\\nan entrance to it, and, by Allah, I will find it! Summon the Habash,\\r\\nTollog! From them or through them we shall have a clew in one way or\\r\\nanother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tollog had fetched the Galla slaves to the beyt of Ibn Jad, the\\r\\nold sheik questioned them but there was none who had definite knowledge\\r\\nof the trail leading to Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, by Allah,\" exclaimed Ibn Jad, \"we shall have it from the native\\r\\nHabash!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They be mighty warriors, O brother,\" cried Tollog, \"and we be far\\r\\nwithin their country. Should we anger them and they set upon us it\\r\\nmight fare ill with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We be Bedauwy,\" said Ibn Jad proudly, \"and we be armed with muskets.\\r\\nWhat could their simple spears and arrows avail against us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they be many and we be few,\" insisted Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall not fight unless we be driven to it,\" said Ibn Jad. \"First we\\r\\nshall seek, by friendly overtures, to win their confidence and cajole\\r\\nthe secret from them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fejjuan!\" he exclaimed, turning to the great black. \"Thou art a\\r\\nHabashy. I have heard thee say that thou well rememberest the days\\r\\nof thy childhood in the hut of thy father and the story of Nimmr was\\r\\nno new story to you. Go, then, and seek out thy people. Make friends\\r\\nwith them. Tell them that the great Sheykh Ibn Jad comes among them in\\r\\nfriendliness and that he hath gifts for their chiefs. Tell them also\\r\\nthat he would visit the city of Nimmr, and if they will lead him there\\r\\nhe will reward them well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I but await thy commands,\" said Fejjuan, elated at this opportunity to\\r\\ndo what he had long dreamed of doing. \"When shall I set forth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prepare thyself tonight and when dawn comes depart,\" replied the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was that Fejjuan, the Galla slave, set forth early the\\r\\nfollowing morning from the menzil of Ibn Jad, sheik of the fendy\\r\\nel-Guad, to search for a village of his own people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy noon he had come upon a well-worn trail leading toward the west,\\r\\nand this he followed boldly, guessing that he would best disarm\\r\\nsuspicion thus than by attempting to approach a Galla village by\\r\\nstealth. Also he well knew that there was little likelihood that he\\r\\ncould accomplish the latter in any event. Fejjuan was no fool. He knew\\r\\nthat it might be difficult to convince the Gallas that he was of their\\r\\nblood, for there was against him not alone his \\'Aarab garments and\\r\\nweapons but the fact that he would be able to speak the Galla tongue\\r\\nbut lamely after all these years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he was a brave man was evidenced by the fact that he well knew the\\r\\nsuspicious and warlike qualities of his people and their inborn hatred\\r\\nof the \\'Aarab and yet gladly embraced this opportunity to go amongst\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow close he had approached a village Fejjuan did not know. There were\\r\\nneither sounds nor odors to enlighten him when there suddenly appeared\\r\\nin the trail ahead of him three husky Galla warriors and behind him he\\r\\nheard others, though he did not turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Fejjuan raised his hands in sign of peace and at the same\\r\\ntime he smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing in the Galla country?\" demanded one of the warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am seeking the house of my father,\" replied Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The house of your father is not in the country of the Gallas,\" growled\\r\\nthe warrior. \"You are one of these who come to rob us of our sons and\\r\\ndaughters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Fejjuan. \"I am a Galla.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were a Galla you would speak the language of the Gallas better.\\r\\nWe understand you, but you do not speak as a Galla speaks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is because I was stolen away when I was a child and have lived\\r\\namong the Bedauwy since, speaking only their tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Bedauwy call me Fejjuan, but my Galla name was Ulala.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think he speaks the truth?\" demanded one of the blacks of a\\r\\ncompanion. \"When I was a child I had a brother whose name was Ulala.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is he?\" asked the other warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do not know. Perhaps simba the lion devoured him. Perhaps the\\r\\ndesert people took him. Who knows?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he speaks the truth,\" said the second warrior. \"Perhaps he is\\r\\nyour brother. Ask him his father\\'s name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was your father\\'s name?\" demanded the first warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naliny,\" replied Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this reply the Galla warriors became excited and whispered among\\r\\nthemselves for several seconds. Then the first warrior turned again to\\r\\nFejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you have a brother?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was his name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tabo,\" answered Fejjuan without hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warrior who had questioned him leaped into the air with a wild\\r\\nshout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Ulala!\" he cried. \"It is my brother. I am Tabo, Ulala. Do you\\r\\nnot remember me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tabo!\" cried Fejjuan. \"No, I would not know you, for you were a little\\r\\nboy when I was stolen away and now you are a great warrior. Where are\\r\\nour father and mother? Are they alive? Are they well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are alive and well, Ulala,\" replied Tabo. \"Today they are in\\r\\nthe village of the chief, for there is a great council because of the\\r\\npresence of some desert people in our country. Came you with them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am a slave to the desert people,\" replied Fejjuan. \"Is it far\\r\\nto the village of the chief? I would see my mother and my father and,\\r\\ntoo, I would talk with the chief about the desert people who have come\\r\\nto the country of the Gallas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, brother!\" cried Tabo. \"We are not far from the village of the\\r\\nchief. Ah, my brother, that I should see you again whom we thought to\\r\\nbe dead all these years! Great will be the joy of our father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, tell me, have the desert people turned you against your own\\r\\npeople? You have lived with them many years. Perhaps you have taken a\\r\\nwife among them. Are you sure that you do not love them better than\\r\\nyou love those whom you have not seen for many years?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not love the Bedauwy,\" replied Fejjuan, \"nor have I taken a wife\\r\\namong them. Always in my heart has been the hope of returning to the\\r\\nmountains of my own country, to the house of my father. I love my own\\r\\npeople, Tabo. Never again shall I leave them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The desert people have been unkind to you--they have treated you with\\r\\ncruelty?\" demanded Tabo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, on the contrary they have treated me well,\" replied Fejjuan. \"I\\r\\ndo not hate them, but neither do I love them. They are not of my own\\r\\nblood. I am a slave among them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they talked the party moved along the trail toward the village while\\r\\ntwo of the warriors ran ahead to carry the glad tidings to the father\\r\\nand mother of the long missing Ulala. And so it was that when they came\\r\\nwithin sight of the village they were met by a great crowd of laughing,\\r\\nshouting Gallas, and in the forerank were the father and mother of\\r\\nFejjuan, their eyes blinded by the tears of love and joy that welled at\\r\\nsight of this long gone child.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the greetings were over, and every man, woman and child in\\r\\nthe company must crowd close and touch the returned wanderer, Tabo\\r\\nconducted Fejjuan into the village and the presence of the chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nBatando was an old man. He had been chief when Ulala was stolen away.\\r\\nHe was inclined to be skeptical, fearing a ruse of the desert people,\\r\\nand he asked many questions of Fejjuan concerning matters that he\\r\\nmight hold in his memory from the days of his childhood. He asked him\\r\\nabout the house of his father and the names of his playmates and other\\r\\nintimate things that an impostor might not know, and when he had done\\r\\nhe arose and took Fejjuan in his arms and rubbed his cheek against the\\r\\ncheek of the prodigal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are indeed Ulala,\" he cried. \"Welcome back to the land of your\\r\\npeople. Tell me now what the desert people do here. Have they come for\\r\\nslaves?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The desert people will always take slaves when they can get them, but\\r\\nIbn Jad has not come first for slaves, but for treasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ai! what treasure?\" demanded Batando.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has heard of the treasure city of Nimmr,\" replied Fejjuan. \"It is\\r\\na way into the valley where lies Nimmr that he seeks. For this he sent\\r\\nme to find Gallas who would lead him to Nimmr. He will make gifts and\\r\\nhe promises rich rewards when he shall have wrested the treasure from\\r\\nNimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are these true words?\" asked Batando.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no truth in the beards of the desert dwellers,\" replied\\r\\nFejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if he does not find the treasure of Nimmr perhaps he will try to\\r\\nfind treasure and slaves in the Galla country to repay the expense of\\r\\nthe long journey he has undertaken from the desert country?\" asked\\r\\nBatando.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Batando speaks out of the great wisdom of many years,\" replied Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does he know of Nimmr?\" asked the old chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naught other than what an old medicine man of the \\'Aarab told him,\"\\r\\nreplied Fejjuan. \"He said to Ibn Jad that great treasure lay hoarded in\\r\\nthe City of Nimmr and that there was a beautiful woman who would bring\\r\\na great price in the far north.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more he told him?\" demanded Batando. \"Did he not tell him of\\r\\nthe difficulties of entering the forbidden valley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we can guide him to the entrance to the valley,\" said Batando,\\r\\nsmiling slyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n                              _Sir James_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tarzan and Zeyd journeyed toward the village in which the ape-man\\r\\npurposed to enlist an escort for the Arab upon the first stage of his\\r\\nreturn journey toward his desert home, the Beduin had time to meditate\\r\\nmuch upon many matters, and having come to trust and respect his savage\\r\\nguide he at last unbosomed himself to Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great Sheykh of the Jungle,\" he said one day, \"by thy kindness thou\\r\\nhast won the undying loyalty of Zeyd who begs that thou wilt grant him\\r\\none more favor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is that?\" asked the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ateja, whom I love, remains here in the savage country in constant\\r\\ndanger so long as Fahd be near her. I dare not now return to the menzil\\r\\nof Ibn Jad even could I find it, but later, when the heat of Ibn Jad\\'s\\r\\nanger will have had time to cool, then I might come again among them\\r\\nand convince him of my innocence, and be near Ateja and protect her\\r\\nfrom Fahd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then, would you do?\" demanded Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would remain in the village to which you are taking me until Ibn Jad\\r\\nreturns this way toward el-Guad. It is the only chance that I have to\\r\\nsee Ateja again in this life, as I could not cross the Soudan alone and\\r\\non foot should you compel me to leave your country now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right,\" replied the ape-man. \"You shall remain here six\\r\\nmonths. If Ibn Jad has not returned in that time I shall leave word\\r\\nthat you be sent to my home. From there I can find a way to return you\\r\\nin safety to your own country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May the blessings of Allah be upon thee!\" cried Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they came at last to the village Tarzan received the promise\\r\\nof the chief to keep Zeyd until Ibn Jad returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had left the village again the ape-man headed north, for he\\r\\nwas concerned over the report that Zeyd had given him of the presence\\r\\nof a European prisoner among the \\'Aarab. That Stimbol, whom he had sent\\r\\neastward toward the coast, should be so far north and west as Zeyd had\\r\\nreported appeared inconceivable, and so it seemed more probable that\\r\\nthe prisoner was young Blake, for whom Tarzan had conceived a liking.\\r\\nOf course the prisoner might not be either Stimbol or Blake, but who\\r\\never he was Tarzan could not readily brook the idea of a white man\\r\\nbeing permitted to remain a prisoner of the Beduins.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Tarzan was in no hurry, for Zeyd had told him that the prisoner\\r\\nwas to be held for ransom. He would have a look about for Blake\\'s\\r\\ncamp first and then follow up the spoor of the Arabs. His progress,\\r\\ntherefore, was leisurely. On the second day he met the apes of Toyat\\r\\nand for two days he hunted with them, renewing his acquaintance with\\r\\nGayat and Zutho, listening to the gossip of the tribe, often playing\\r\\nwith the balus.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving them, he loafed on through the jungle, stopping once for half\\r\\na day to bait Numa where he lay upon a fresh kill, until the earth\\r\\ntrembled to the thunderous roars of the maddened king of beasts as the\\r\\nape-man taunted and annoyed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSloughed was the thin veneer of civilization that was Lord Greystoke;\\r\\nback to the primitive, back to the savage beast the ape-man reverted\\r\\nas naturally, as simply, as once changes from one suit to another. It\\r\\nwas only in his beloved jungle, surrounded by its savage denizens,\\r\\nthat Tarzan of the Apes was truly Tarzan, for always in the presence\\r\\nof civilized men there was a certain restraint that was the outcome of\\r\\nthat inherent suspicion that creatures of the wild ever feel for man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTired of throwing ripe fruit at Numa, Tarzan swung away through the\\r\\nmiddle terraces of the forest, lay up for the night far away and in the\\r\\nmorning, scenting Bara the deer, made a kill and fed. Lazy, he slept\\r\\nagain, until the breaking of twigs and the rustle of down tramped\\r\\ngrasses awoke him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sniffed the air with sensitive nostrils and listened with ears that\\r\\ncould hear an ant walk, and then he smiled. Tantor was coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half a day he lolled on the huge back, listening to Manu the Monkey\\r\\nchattering and scolding among the trees. Then he moved on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two later he came upon a large band of monkeys. They seemed\\r\\nmuch excited and at sight of him they all commenced to jabber and\\r\\nchatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Greetings, Manu!\" cried the ape-man. \"I am Tarzan, Tarzan of the Apes.\\r\\nWhat happens in the jungle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gomangani! Gomangani!\" cried one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange Gomangani!\" cried another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gomangani with thunder sticks!\" chattered a third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\" asked the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There! There!\" they shouted in chorus, pointing toward the northeast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many sleeps away?\" asked Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Close! Close!\" the monkeys answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is one Tarmangani with them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, only Gomangani. With their thunder sticks they kill little Manu\\r\\nand eat him. Bad Gomangani!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan will talk with them,\" said the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will kill Tarzan with their thunder sticks and eat him,\"\\r\\nprophesied a gray-beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man laughed and swung off through the trees in the direction\\r\\nManu had indicated. He had not gone far when the scent spoor of blacks\\r\\ncame faintly to his nostrils and this spoor he followed until presently\\r\\nhe could hear their voices in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently, warily Tarzan came through the trees, noiseless as the\\r\\nshadows that kept him company, until he stood upon a swaying limb\\r\\ndirectly above a camp of negroes.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Tarzan recognized the safari of the young American, Blake,\\r\\nand a second later he dropped to the ground before the astonished eyes\\r\\nof the blacks. Some of them would have run, but others recognized him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Big Bwana!\" they cried. \"It is Tarzan of the Apes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your head man?\" demanded Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stalwart negro approached him. \"I am head man,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your master?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is gone, many days,\" replied the black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do not know. He hunted with a single askar. There was a great\\r\\nstorm. Neither of them ever returned. We searched the jungle for them,\\r\\nbut could not find them. We waited in camp where they were to have\\r\\njoined us. They did not come. We did not know what to do. We would\\r\\nnot desert the young Bwana, who was kind to us; but we feared that he\\r\\nwas dead. We have not provisions to last more than another moon. We\\r\\ndecided to return home and tell our story to the friends of the young\\r\\nBwana.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have done well,\" said Tarzan. \"Have you seen a company of the\\r\\ndesert people in the jungle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not seen them,\" replied the head man, \"but while we were\\r\\nsearching for the young Bwana we saw where desert people had camped. It\\r\\nwas a fresh camp.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black pointed. \"It was on the trail to the north Galla country in\\r\\nAbyssinia and when they broke camp they went north.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may return to your village,\" said Tarzan, \"but first take those\\r\\nthings which are the young Bwana\\'s to his friends to keep for him and\\r\\nsend a runner to the home of Tarzan with this message: Send one hundred\\r\\nWaziri to Tarzan in the north Galla country. From the water hole of the\\r\\nsmooth, round rocks follow the trail of the desert people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Big Bwana, it will be done,\" said the head man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Repeat my message.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black boy did as he was bidden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!\" said Tarzan. \"I go. Kill not Manu the monkey if you can find\\r\\nother food, for Manu is the cousin of Tarzan and of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We understand, Big Bwana.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the castle of Prince Gobred in the City of Nimmr James Hunter Blake\\r\\nwas being schooled in the duties of a Knight of Nimmr. Sir Richard had\\r\\ntaken him under his protection and made himself responsible for his\\r\\ntraining and his conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Gobred, quick to realize Blake\\'s utter ignorance of even the\\r\\nsimplest observances of knighthood, was frankly skeptical, and Sir\\r\\nMalud was almost openly antagonistic, but the loyal Sir Richard was a\\r\\nwell beloved knight and so he had his way. Perhaps, too, the influence\\r\\nof the Princess Guinalda was not without its effect upon her sire, for\\r\\nfirst among the treasures of the Prince of Nimmr ranked his daughter\\r\\nGuinalda; and Guinalda\\'s curiosity and interest had been excited by the\\r\\nromance of the coming of this fair stranger knight to the buried and\\r\\nforgotten city of Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard had clothed Blake from his own wardrobe until a weaver,\\r\\na cutter of cloth, a seamstress and an armorer could fashion one for\\r\\nhim. Nor did it take long. A week found Sir James clothed, armored and\\r\\nhorsed as befitted a Knight of Nimmr, and when he spoke to Sir Richard\\r\\nof payment for all this he found that money was almost unknown among\\r\\nthem. There were, Sir Richard told him, a few pieces of coin that their\\r\\nancestors had brought here seven hundred and thirty-five years before,\\r\\nbut payment was made by service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knights served the prince and he kept them. They protected the\\r\\nlaborers and the artisans and in return received what they required\\r\\nfrom them. The slaves received their food and clothing from the prince\\r\\nor from whichever knight they served. Jewels and precious metals often\\r\\nchanged hands in return for goods or service, but each transaction was\\r\\na matter of barter as there were no standards of value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey cared little for wealth. The knights valued most highly their\\r\\nhonor and their courage upon which there could be no price. The artisan\\r\\nfound his reward in the high perfection of his handicraft and in the\\r\\nhonors that it brought him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe valley provided food in plenty for all; the slaves tilled the\\r\\nground; the freedmen were the artisans, the men-at-arms, the herders\\r\\nof cattle; the knights defended Nimmr against its enemies, competed\\r\\nin tourneys and hunted wild game in the valley and its surrounding\\r\\nmountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days passed Blake found himself rapidly acquiring a certain\\r\\nproficiency in knightly arts under the wise tutorage of Sir Richard.\\r\\nThe use of sword and buckler he found most difficult, notwithstanding\\r\\nthe fact that he had been proficient with the foils in his college\\r\\ndays, for the knights of Nimmr knew naught of the defensive use of\\r\\ntheir two edged weapons and seldom used the point for other purpose\\r\\nthan the _coup-de-grace_. For them the sword was almost wholly a\\r\\ncutting weapon, the buckler their sole defense; but as Blake practiced\\r\\nwith this weapon it dawned upon him that his knowledge of fencing\\r\\nmight be put to advantage should the necessity arise, to the end that\\r\\nhis awkwardness with the buckler should be outweighed by his nicer\\r\\ndefensive handling of his sword and his offensive improved by the\\r\\njudicious use of the point, against which they had developed little or\\r\\nno defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lance he found less difficult, its value being so largely dependent\\r\\nupon the horsemanship of him who wielded it, and that Blake was a\\r\\nsplendid horseman was evidenced by his polo rating as an eight goal man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballium, or outer court, which lay between the inner and outer\\r\\nwalls of the castle and entirely surrounded it, was, upon the north or\\r\\nvalley side, given over entirely to knightly practice and training.\\r\\nHere the ballium was very wide, and against the inner wall was built\\r\\na wooden grand stand that could be quickly removed in the event of an\\r\\nattack upon the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nJusts and tilts were held here weekly, while the great tourneys that\\r\\noccurred less often were given upon a field outside the castle wall\\r\\nupon the floor of the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaily many knights and ladies came to watch the practice and training\\r\\nthat filled the ballium with life and action and color during the\\r\\nmorning hours. Good-natured banter flew back and forth, wagers were\\r\\nlaid, and woe betide the contender who was unhorsed during these\\r\\npractice bouts, for the thing that a knight dreaded even more than he\\r\\ndreaded death was ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the formal jousts that were held weekly greater decorum was observed\\r\\nby the audience, but during the daily practice their raillery verged\\r\\nupon brutality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was before such an audience as this that Blake received his\\r\\ntraining, and because he was a novelty the audiences were larger than\\r\\nusual, and because the friends of Sir Malud and the friends of Sir\\r\\nRichard had tacitly acknowledged him as an issue both the applause and\\r\\nthe ridicule were loud and boisterous.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the Prince came often and Guinalda always was there. It was\\r\\nsoon apparent that Prince Gobred leaned slightly to the side of Sir\\r\\nMalud, with the natural result that Malud\\'s party immediately acquired\\r\\nnumerous recruits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training of the lads who were squires to the knights and who would\\r\\none day be admitted to the charmed circle of knighthood occupied the\\r\\nearlier hours of the morning. This was followed by practice tilts\\r\\nbetween knights, during which Sir Richard or one of his friends\\r\\nundertook the training of Blake at the far side of the ballium, and it\\r\\nwas during this practice that the American\\'s outstanding horsemanship\\r\\nbecame apparent, even Gobred being led to applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Od\\'s bodikins,\" he exclaimed, \"the man be a part of his charger!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Twas but chance that saved him from a fall,\" said Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mayhap,\" agreed Gobred, \"but at that me likes the looks of him within\\r\\na saddle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He doeth not too ill with his lance,\" admitted Malud. \"But, \\'od\\'s\\r\\nblud! didst ever see a more awkward lout with a buckler? Methinks\\r\\nhe hath had more use for a trencher.\" This sally elicited roars of\\r\\nlaughter in which the Princess Guinalda did not join, a fact which\\r\\nMalud, whose eyes were often upon her, was quick to note. \"Thou still\\r\\nbelievest this churl to be a knight, Princess Guinalda?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have I said aught?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou didst not laugh,\" he reminded her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a stranger knight, far from his own country and it seemeth not a\\r\\nknightly nor a gentle thing to ridicule him,\" she replied. \"Therefore I\\r\\ndid not laugh, for I was not amused.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that day as Blake joined the others in the great court, he ran\\r\\ndirectly into Malud\\'s party, nor was it at all an accident, as he never\\r\\nmade any effort to avoid Malud or his friends and was, seemingly,\\r\\noblivious to their thinly veiled taunts and insinuations. Malud himself\\r\\nattributed this to the density and ignorance of a yokel, which he\\r\\ninsisted Blake to be, but there were others who rather admired Blake\\r\\nfor his attitude, seeing in it a studied affront that Malud was too\\r\\ndense to perceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the inmates of the grim castle of Nimmr were inclined\\r\\npleasantly toward the newcomer. He had brought with him an air\\r\\nof freshness and newness that was rather a relief from the hoary\\r\\natmosphere that had surrounded Nimmr for nearly seven and a half\\r\\ncenturies. He had brought them new words and new expressions and new\\r\\nviews, which many of them were joyously adopting, and had it not been\\r\\nfor the unreasoning antagonism of the influential Sir Malud, Blake had\\r\\nbeen accepted with open arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard was far more popular than Malud, but lacked the latter\\'s\\r\\nwealth in horses, arms and retainers and consequently had less\\r\\ninfluence with Prince Gobred. However there were many independent\\r\\nsouls who either followed Sir Richard because they were fond of him or\\r\\narrived at their own decisions without reference to the dictates of\\r\\npolicy, and many of these were staunch friends to Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all of those who surrounded Malud this afternoon were antagonistic\\r\\nto the American, but the majority of them laughed when Malud laughed\\r\\nand frowned when he frowned, for in the courts of kings and princes\\r\\nflourished the first order of \"yes men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was greeted by many a smile and nod as he advanced and bowed low\\r\\nbefore the Princess Guinalda who was one of the company and, being of\\r\\nprincely blood, intitled to his first devoirs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou didst well this morning, Sir James,\" said the princess, kindly.\\r\\n\"It pleases me greately to see thee ride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Methinketh \\'twould be a rarer treat to see him serve a side of\\r\\nvenison,\" sneered Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis provoked so much laughter that Malud was encouraged to seek\\r\\nfurther applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Odzooks!\" he cried, \"arm him with a trencher and carving knife and he\\r\\nwould be at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speaking of serving,\" said Blake, \"and Sir Malud\\'s mind seems to be\\r\\nmore occupied with that than with more knightly things, does any of you\\r\\nknow what is necessary quickly to serve fresh pig?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, fair sir knight,\" said Guinalda, \"we know not. Prithee tell us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, tell us,\" roared Malud, \"thou, indeed, shouldst know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said a mouthful, old scout, I do know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what be necessary that you may quickly serve fresh pig?\" demanded\\r\\nMalud, looking about him and winking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A trencher, a carving knife and you, Sir Malud,\" replied Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was several seconds before the thrust penetrated their simple minds\\r\\nand it was the Princess Guinalda who first broke into merry laughter\\r\\nand soon all were roaring, while some explained the quip to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, not all were laughing--not Sir Malud. When he grasped the\\r\\nsignificance of Blake\\'s witticism he first turned very red and then\\r\\nwent white, for the great Sir Malud liked not to be the butt of\\r\\nridicule, which is ever the way of those most prone to turn ridicule\\r\\nupon others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sirrah,\" he cried, \"darest thou affront Malud? \\'Od\\'s blud, fellow! Low\\r\\nborn varlet! Only thy blood canst atone this affront!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hop to it, old thing!\" replied Blake. \"Name your poison!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knowest not the meaning of thy silly words,\" cried Malud, \"but I\\r\\nknow that an\\' thou doest not meet me in fair tilt upon the morrow I\\r\\nshalt whip thee across the Valley of the Holy Sepulcher with a barrel\\r\\nstave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re on!\" snapped back Blake. \"Tomorrow morning in the south ballium\\r\\nwith----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou mayst choose the weapons, sirrah,\" said Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t call me sirrah, I don\\'t like it,\" said Blake very quietly, and\\r\\nnow he was not smiling. \"I want to tell you something, Malud, that may\\r\\nbe good for your soul. You are really the only man in Nimmr who didn\\'t\\r\\nwant to treat me well and give me a chance, a fair chance, to prove\\r\\nthat I am all right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think you are a great knight, but you are not. You have no\\r\\nintelligence, no heart, no chivalry. You are not what we would call in\\r\\nmy country a good sport. You have a few horses and a few men-at-arms.\\r\\nThat is all you have, for without them you would not have the favor of\\r\\nthe Prince, and without his favor you would have no friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not so good or great a man in any way as is Sir Richard,\\r\\nwho combines all the qualities of chivalry that for centuries have\\r\\nglorified the order of knighthood; nor are you so good a man as I, who,\\r\\nwith your own weapons, will best you on the morrow when, in the north\\r\\nballium, I meet you on horseback with sword and buckler!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of the party, upon seeing Malud\\'s wrath had gradually\\r\\nfallen away from Blake until, as he concluded his speech, he stood\\r\\nalone a few paces apart from Malud and those who surrounded him. Then\\r\\nit was that one stepped from among those at Malud\\'s side and walked to\\r\\nBlake. It was Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir James,\" she said with a sweet smile, \"thou spokest with thy mouth\\r\\nfull!\" She broke into a merry laugh. \"Walk with me in the garden, sir\\r\\nknight,\" and taking his arm she guided him toward the south end of the\\r\\neastern court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re wonderful!\" was all that Blake could find to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost really think I be wonderful?\" she demanded. \"\\'Tis hard to know\\r\\nif men speak the truth to such as I. The truth, as people see it, is\\r\\nspoke more oft to slaves than princes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope to prove it by my conduct,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had drawn a short distance away from the others now and the girl\\r\\nsuddenly laid her hand impulsively upon his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I brought thee away, Sir James, that I might speak with thee alone,\"\\r\\nshe said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not care what the reason was so long as you did it,\" he replied,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art a stranger among us, unaccustomed to our ways, unversed in\\r\\nknightly practice--so much so that there are many who doubt thy claims\\r\\nto knighthood. Yet thou art a brave man, or else a very simple one,\\r\\nor thou wouldst never have chosen to meet Sir Malud with sword and\\r\\nbuckler, for he be skilled with these while thou art clumsy with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I thinkest that thou goest to thy death tomorrow I have\\r\\nbrought thee aside to speak with thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be done about it now?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art passing fair with thy lance,\" she said, \"and it is still not\\r\\ntoo late to change thy selection of weapons. I beg thee to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You care?\" he asked. There can be a world of meaning in two words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s eyes dropped for an instant and then flashed up to his and\\r\\nthere was a touch of hauteur in them. \"I am the daughter of the Prince\\r\\nof Nimmr,\" she said. \"I care for the humblest of my father\\'s subjects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess that will hold you for a while, Sir James,\" thought Blake, but\\r\\nto the girl he said nothing, only smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she stamped her foot. \"Thou hast an impudent smile, sirrah!\"\\r\\nshe exclaimed angrily. \"Meliketh it not. Then thou art too forward with\\r\\nthe daughter of a prince.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I merely asked you if you cared whether I was killed. Even a cat could\\r\\nask that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I replied. Why then didst thou smile?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because your eyes had answered me before your lips had spoken and I\\r\\nknew that your eyes had told the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she stamped her foot angrily. \"Thou art indeed a forward boor,\"\\r\\nshe exclaimed. \"I shall not remain to be insulted further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head held high she turned and walked haughtily away to rejoin the\\r\\nother party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake stepped quickly after her. \"Tomorrow,\" he whispered, \"I meet Sir\\r\\nMalud with sword and buckler. With your favor upon my helm I could\\r\\noverthrow the best sword in Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess Guinalda did not deign to acknowledge that she had heard\\r\\nhis words as she walked on to join the others clustered about Sir\\r\\nMalud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n                       \"_Tomorrow Thou Diest!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a great celebration in the village of Batando the chief the\\r\\nnight that Ulala returned. A goat was killed and many chickens, and\\r\\nthere were fruit and cassava bread and native beer in plenty for all.\\r\\nThere was music, too, and dancing. With all of which it was morning\\r\\nbefore they sought their sleeping mats, with the result that it was\\r\\nafter noon the following day before Fejjuan had an opportunity to speak\\r\\nof serious matters with Batando.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen finally he sought him out he found the old chief squatting in the\\r\\nshade before his hut, slightly the worse for the orgy of the preceding\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come to talk with you, Batando,\" he said, \"of the desert\\r\\npeople.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBatando grunted. His head ached.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday you said that you would lead them to the entrance to the\\r\\nforbidden valley,\" said Fejjuan. \"You mean, then, that you will not\\r\\nfight them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall not have to fight them if we lead them to the entrance to the\\r\\nforbidden valley,\" replied Batando.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak in riddles,\" said Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen, Ulala,\" replied the old chief. \"In childhood you were stolen\\r\\nfrom your people and taken from your country. Being young, there\\r\\nwere many things you did not know and there are others that you have\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not difficult to enter the forbidden valley, especially from\\r\\nthe north. Every Galla knows how to find the northern pass through the\\r\\nmountains or the tunnel beyond the great cross that marks the southern\\r\\nentrance. There are only these two ways in--every Galla knows them;\\r\\nbut every Galla also knows that there is no way out of the forbidden\\r\\nvalley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Batando?\" demanded Fejjuan. \"If there are two ways\\r\\nin, there must be two ways out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--there is no way out,\" insisted the chief. \"As far back as goes\\r\\nthe memory of man or the tales of our fathers and our fathers\\' fathers\\r\\nit is known that many men have entered the forbidden valley, and it is\\r\\nalso known that no man has ever come out of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why have they not come out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBatando shook his head. \"Who knows?\" he asked. \"We cannot even guess\\r\\ntheir fate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of people inhabit the valley?\" asked Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not even that is known. No man has seen them and returned to tell.\\r\\nSome say they are the spirits of the dead, others that the valley is\\r\\npeopled by leopards; but no one knows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go therefore, Ulala, and tell the chief of the desert people that we\\r\\nwill lead him to the entrance to the valley. If we do this we shall not\\r\\nhave to fight him and his people, nor shall we ever again be bothered\\r\\nby them,\" and Batando laughed at his little joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you send guides back with me to lead the Bedauwy to the valley?\"\\r\\nasked Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied the chief. \"Tell them we shall come in three days. In the\\r\\nmeantime I shall gather together many warriors from other villages, for\\r\\nI do not trust the desert people. Thus we shall conduct them through\\r\\nour country. Explain this to their chief and also that in payment he\\r\\nmust release to us all the Galla slaves he has with him--before he\\r\\nenters the valley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Ibn Jad will not do,\" said Fejjuan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, when he sees himself surrounded by Galla warriors, he will be\\r\\nglad to do even more,\" replied Batando.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Fejjuan, the Galla slave, returned to his masters and reported\\r\\nall that Batando had told him to report.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad at first refused to give up his slaves, but when Fejjuan\\r\\nhad convinced him that under no other terms would Batando lead him\\r\\nto the entrance to the valley, and that his refusal to liberate the\\r\\nslaves would invite the hostile attentions of the Gallas, he finally\\r\\nconsented; but in the back of his mind was the thought that before his\\r\\npromise was consummated he might find an opportunity to evade it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one regret had Fejjuan in betraying the Beduins, and that was\\r\\ncaused by his liking for Ateja, but being a fatalist he was consoled by\\r\\nthe conviction that whatever was to be, would be, regardless of what he\\r\\nmight do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Ibn Jad waited and Batando gathered his black warriors from far\\r\\nand near, Tarzan of the Apes came to the water hole of the smooth,\\r\\nround rocks and took up the trail of the Beduins.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince he had learned from Blake\\'s blacks that the young American was\\r\\nmissing and also that they had seen nothing of Stimbol since the latter\\r\\nhad separated from Blake and started for the coast, the ape-man was\\r\\nmore convinced than ever that the white prisoner among the Arabs was\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill he felt no great concern for the man\\'s safety, for if the Beduins\\r\\nhad sufficient hopes of reward to spare his life at all he was in no\\r\\ngreat danger from them. Reasoning thus Tarzan made no pretense of speed\\r\\nas he followed the spoor of Ibn Jad and his people.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men sat upon rough benches at opposite sides of a rude table.\\r\\nBetween them a cresset of oil with a cotton wick laying in it burned\\r\\nfeebly, slightly illuminating the stone flagging of the floor and\\r\\ncasting weird shadows of themselves upon the rough stone walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a narrow window, innocent of glass, the night air blew, driving\\r\\nthe flame of the cresset now this way, now that. Upon the table,\\r\\nbetween the men, lay a square board blocked off into squares, and\\r\\nwithin some of these were several wooden pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is your move, Richard,\" said one of the men. \"You don\\'t appear to\\r\\nbe very keen about the game tonight. What\\'s the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I be thinking of the morrow, James, and my heart be heavy within me,\"\\r\\nreplied the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Malud is not the best swordsman in Nimmr,\" replied Sir Richard,\\r\\n\"but----\" he hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the worst,\" Blake finished the sentence for him, laughingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard looked up and smiled. \"Thou wilt always joke, even in the\\r\\nface of death,\" he said. \"Art all the men of this strange country thou\\r\\ntell\\'st of alike?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is your move, Richard,\" said Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hide not his sword from thine eyes with thy buckler, James,\" cautioned\\r\\nRichard. \"Ever keep thine eyes upon his eyes until thou knowest whereat\\r\\nhe striketh, then, with thy buckler ready, thou mayst intercept the\\r\\nblow, for he be over slow and always his eyes proclaim where his blade\\r\\nwill fall. Full well I knoweth that for often have I exercised against\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he hasn\\'t killed you,\" Blake reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, we did but practice, but on the morrow it will be different, for\\r\\nMalud engages thee to the death, in mortal combat my friend, to wash\\r\\naway in blood the affront thou didst put upon him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He wants to kill me, just for that?\" asked Blake. \"I\\'ll tell the world\\r\\nhe\\'s a touchy little rascal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it only that, he might be satisfied merely to draw blood, but\\r\\nthere is more that he hath against thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More? What? I\\'ve scarcely spoken to him a dozen times,\" said Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He be jealous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jealous? Of whom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would wed the Princess and he hath seen in what manner thou lookest\\r\\nat her,\" explained Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poppycock!\" cried Blake, but he flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, he be not the only one who hath marked it,\" insisted Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re crazy,\" snapped Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Often men look thus at the princess, for she be beautiful beyond\\r\\ncompare, but----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has he killed them all?\" demanded the American.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, for the princess didst not look back at _them_ in the same manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake leaned back upon his bench and laughed. \"Now I know you\\'re\\r\\ncrazy,\" he cried, \"all of you. I\\'ll admit that I think the princess is\\r\\na mighty sweet kid, but say young fellow, she can\\'t see me a little\\r\\nbit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough of thy outlandish speech I grasp to gather thy meaning, James,\\r\\nbut thou canst not confuse me upon the one subject nor deceive me upon\\r\\nthe other. The eyes of the princess seldom leave thee whilst thou art\\r\\nat practice upon the lists and the look in thine when they rest upon\\r\\nher--hast ever seen a hound adoring his master?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run along and sell your papers,\" admonished Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For this, Malud wouldst put thee out of the way and it is because I\\r\\nknow this that I grieve, for I have learned to like thee over well, my\\r\\nfriend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake arose and came around the end of the table. \"You\\'re a good old\\r\\nscout, Richard,\" he said, placing a hand affectionately upon the\\r\\nother\\'s shoulder, \"but do not worry--I am not dead yet. I know I seem\\r\\nawkward with the sword, but I have learned much about its possibilities\\r\\nwithin the past few days and I think that Sir Malud has a surprise\\r\\nawaiting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy courage and thy vast assurance should carry thee far, James, but\\r\\nthey may not overcome a lifetime of practice with the sword, and that\\r\\nis the advantage Malud hath over thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does Prince Gobred favor Malud\\'s suit?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? Malud is a powerful knight, with a great castle of his own\\r\\nand many horses and retainers. Besides a dozen knights he hath fully an\\r\\nhundred men-at-arms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are several knights who have their own castles and following are\\r\\nthere not?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty, perchance,\" replied Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they live close to Gobred\\'s castle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the edge of the hills, within three leagues upon either hand of\\r\\nGobred\\'s castle,\" explained Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And no others live in all this great valley?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have heard mention made of Bohun?\" asked Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, often--why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He calls himself king, but never will we refer to him as king. He and\\r\\nhis followers dwell upon the opposite side of the valley. They number,\\r\\nperchance, as many as we and we be always at war against them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I\\'ve been hearing quite a bit about a great tournament for which\\r\\nthe knights are practicing now. I thought that Bohun and his knights\\r\\nwere to take part in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They be. Once each year, commencing upon the first Sunday of Lent\\r\\nand extending over a period of three days, there hath been from time\\r\\nimmemorial a truce declared between the Fronters and the Backers,\\r\\nduring which is held the Great Tourney, one year in the plain before\\r\\nthe city of Nimmr and the next year in the plain before the City of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher, as they call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fronters and Backers! What in heck do those mean?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art a knight of Nimmr and know not that?\" exclaimed Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I know about knighting would rattle around in a peanut shell,\"\\r\\nadmitted Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shouldst know and I shalt tell thee. Hark thee well, then,\" said\\r\\nRichard, \"for I must need go back to the very beginning.\" He poured\\r\\ntwo goblets of wine from a flagon standing on the floor beside him,\\r\\ntook a long drink and proceeded with his tale. \"Richard I sailed from\\r\\nSicily in the spring of 1191 with all his great following bound for\\r\\nAcre, where he was to meet the French king, Philip Augustus, and wrest\\r\\nthe Holy Land from the power of the Saracen. But Richard tarried upon\\r\\nthe way to conquer Cyprus and punish the vile despot who had placed an\\r\\ninsult upon Berengaria, whom Richard was to wed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the great company again set their sails for Acre there were many\\r\\nCyprian maidens hidden away upon the ships by knights who had taken a\\r\\nfancy to their lovely faces, and it so befell that two of these ships,\\r\\nencountering a storm, were blown from their course and wrecked upon the\\r\\nAfric shore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of these companies was commanded by a knight y-clept Bohun and\\r\\nthe other by one Gobred and though they marched together they kept\\r\\nseparate other than when attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thus, searching for Jerusalem, they came upon this valley which the\\r\\nfollowers of Bohun declared was the Valley of the Holy Sepulcher and\\r\\nthat the crusade was over. Their crosses, that they had worn upon their\\r\\nbreasts as do all crusaders who have not reached their goal, they\\r\\nremoved and placed upon their backs to signify that the crusade was\\r\\nover and that they were returning home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gobred insisted that this was not the Valley of the Holy Sepulcher\\r\\nand that the crusade was not accomplished. He, therefore, and all his\\r\\nfollowers, retained their crosses upon their breasts and built a city\\r\\nand a strong castle to defend the entrance to the valley that Bohun and\\r\\nhis followers might be prevented from returning to England until they\\r\\nhad accomplished their mission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bohun crossed the valley and built a city and a castle to prevent\\r\\nGobred from pushing on in the direction in which the latter knew that\\r\\nthe true Sepulcher lay, and for nearly seven and a half centuries the\\r\\ndescendants of Bohun have prevented the descendants of Gobred from\\r\\npushing on and rescuing the Holy Land from the Saracen, while the\\r\\ndescendants of Gobred have prevented the descendants of Bohun from\\r\\nreturning to England, to the dishonor of knighthood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gobred took the title of prince and Bohun that of king and these\\r\\ntitles have been handed down from father to son during the centuries,\\r\\nwhile the followers of Gobred still wear the cross upon their breasts\\r\\nand are called therefrom, the Fronters, and the followers of Bohun wear\\r\\ntheirs upon their backs and are called Backers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you would still push on and liberate the Holy Land?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Richard, \"and the Backers would return to England; but\\r\\nlong since have we realized the futility of either hope since we be\\r\\nsurrounded by a vast army of Saracens and our numbers be too few to pit\\r\\nagainst them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thinkest thou not that we are wise to remain here under such stress?\"\\r\\nhe demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'d certainly surprise \\'em if you rode into Jerusalem, or\\r\\nLondon, either,\" admitted Blake. \"On the whole, Richard, I\\'d remain\\r\\nright here, if I were you. You see, after seven hundred and thirty-five\\r\\nyears most of the home folks may have forgotten you and even the\\r\\nSaracens might not know what it was all about if you came charging into\\r\\nJerusalem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mayhap you speak wisely, James,\" said Richard, \"and then, too, we be\\r\\ncontent here, knowing no other country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while both men were silent, in thought. Blake was the first to\\r\\nspeak. \"This big tourney interests me,\" he said. \"You say it starts the\\r\\nfirst Sunday in Lent. That\\'s not far away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not far. Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was wondering if you thought I\\'d be in shape to have a part in it.\\r\\nI\\'m getting better and better with the lance every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard looked sadly at him and shook his head. \"Tomorrow thou wilt\\r\\nbe dead,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say! You\\'re a cheerful party,\" exclaimed Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am only truthful, good friend,\" replied Richard. \"It grieveth my\\r\\nheart sorely that it should be true, but true it be--thou canst not\\r\\nprevail over Sir Malud on the morrow. Wouldst that I might take thy\\r\\nplace in the lists against him, but that may not be. But I console\\r\\nmyself with the thought that thou wilt comport thyself courageously and\\r\\ndie as a good sir knight should, with no stain upon thy escutcheon.\\r\\nGreatly will it solace the Princess Guinalda to know that thou didst\\r\\ndie thus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think so?\" ventured Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Verily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I don\\'t die--will she be put out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put out! Put out of what?\" demanded Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will she be sore vexed, then,\" corrected Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not go so far as to say that,\" admitted Richard, \"but\\r\\nnatheless it appears certain that no lady would rejoice to see her\\r\\npromised husband overthrown and killed, and if thou art not slain it\\r\\nmay only be because thou hast slain Malud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is his affianced wife?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis understood, that be all. As yet no formal marriage bans have been\\r\\nproclaimed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to turn in,\" snapped Blake. \"If I\\'ve got to be killed\\r\\ntomorrow I ought to get a little sleep tonight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he stretched himself upon a rough wool blanket that was spread over\\r\\na bed of rushes upon the stone floor in one corner of the room and\\r\\ndrew another similar blanket over him, he felt less like sleep than he\\r\\nhad ever felt before. The knowledge that on the morrow he was to meet\\r\\na medieval knight in mortal combat naturally gave him considerable\\r\\nconcern, but Blake was too self-reliant and too young to seriously\\r\\nharbor the belief that he would be the one to be killed. He knew it\\r\\nwas possible but he did not intend to permit the thought to upset\\r\\nhim. There was, however, another that did. It upset him very much\\r\\nand, too, it made him angry when he realized that he was concerned\\r\\nabout it--about the proposed marriage of Sir Malud of West Castle and\\r\\nGuinalda, Princess of Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould it be that he had been ass enough, he soliloquized, to have\\r\\nfallen in love with this little medieval princess who probably looked\\r\\nupon him as dirt beneath her feet? And what was he going to do about\\r\\nMalud? Suppose he should get the better of the fellow on the morrow?\\r\\nWell, what about it? If he killed him that would make Guinalda unhappy.\\r\\nIf he didn\\'t kill him--what? Sir James did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n                         _In the Beyt of Zeyd_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad waited three days in his menzil but no Galla guides arrived\\r\\nto lead him into the valley as Batando had promised, and so he sent\\r\\nFejjuan once more to the chief to urge him to hasten, for always in the\\r\\nmind of Ibn Jad was the fear of Tarzan of the Apes and the thought that\\r\\nhe might return to thwart and punish him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew he was out of Tarzan\\'s country now, but he also knew that where\\r\\nboundaries were so vague he could not definitely count upon this fact\\r\\nas an assurance of safety from reprisal. His one hope was that Tarzan\\r\\nwas awaiting his return through Tarzan\\'s country, and this Ibn Jad had\\r\\ndefinitely decided not to attempt. Instead he was planning upon moving\\r\\ndirectly west, passing north of the ape-man\\'s stamping grounds, until\\r\\nhe picked up the trail to the north down which he had travelled from\\r\\nthe desert country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mukaad of the sheik with Ibn Jad sat Tollog, his brother, and\\r\\nFahd and Stimbol, besides some other \\'Aarab. They were speaking of\\r\\nBatando\\'s delay in sending guides and they were fearful of treachery,\\r\\nfor it had long been apparent to them that the old chief was gathering\\r\\na great army of warriors, and though Fejjuan assured them that they\\r\\nwould not be used against the \\'Aarab if Ibn Jad resorted to no\\r\\ntreachery, yet they were all apprehensive of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja, employed with the duties of the hareem, did not sing nor smile\\r\\nas had been her wont, for her heart was heavy with mourning for her\\r\\nlover. She heard the talk in the mukaad but it did not interest her.\\r\\nSeldom did her eyes glance above the curtain that separated the women\\'s\\r\\nquarters from the mukaad, and when they did the fires of hatred blazed\\r\\nwithin them as they crossed the countenance of Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe chanced to be thus glancing when she saw Fahd\\'s eyes, which were\\r\\ndirected outward across the menzil, go suddenly wide with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, Ibn Jad!\" cried the man. \"Look!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the others Ateja glanced in the direction Fahd was staring and\\r\\nwith the others she voiced a little gasp of astonishment, though those\\r\\nof the men were rounded into oaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking straight across the menzil toward the sheik\\'s beyt strode a\\r\\nbronzed giant armed with a spear, arrows and a knife. Upon his back was\\r\\nsuspended an oval shield and across one shoulder and his breast was\\r\\ncoiled a rope, hand plaited from long fibers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan of the Apes!\" ejaculated Ibn Jad. \"The curse of Ullah be upon\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must have brought his black warriors with him and left them hidden\\r\\nin the forest,\" whispered Tollog. \"Not else would he dare enter the\\r\\nmenzil of the Beduw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad was heart sick and he was thinking fast when the ape-man halted\\r\\ndirectly in the outer opening of the mukaad. Tarzan let his eyes run\\r\\nquickly over the assemblage. They stopped upon Stimbol, finally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Blake?\" he demanded of the American.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ought to know,\" growled Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you seen him since you and he separated?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are sure of that?\" insisted the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan turned to Ibn Jad. \"You have lied to me. You are not here to\\r\\ntrade but to find and sack a city; to take its treasure and steal its\\r\\nwomen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a lie!\" cried Ibn Jad. \"Whoever told thee that, lied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think he lied,\" replied Tarzan. \"He seemed an honest youth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was he?\" demanded Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name is Zeyd.\" Ateja heard and was suddenly galvanized to new\\r\\ninterest. \"He says all this and more, and I believe him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What else did he tell thee, Nasrany?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That another stole his musket and sought to slay thee, Ibn Jad, and\\r\\nthen put the blame upon him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a lie, like all he hath told thee!\" cried Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad sat in thought, his brows contracted in a dark scowl, but\\r\\npresently he looked up at Tarzan with a crooked smile. \"Doubtless the\\r\\npoor youth thought that he spoke the truth,\" he said. \"Just as he\\r\\nthought that he should slay his sheykh and for the same reason. Always\\r\\nhath his brain been sick, but never before did I think him dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hath deceived thee, Tarzan of the Apes, and that I can prove by all\\r\\nmy people as well as by this Nasrany I have befriended, for all will\\r\\ntell thee that I am seeking to obey thee and leave thy country. Why\\r\\nelse then should I have travelled north back in the direction of my own\\r\\nbeled?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If thou wished to obey me why didst thou hold me prisoner and send thy\\r\\nbrother to slay me in the night?\" asked Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Again thou wrongst Ibn Jad,\" said the sheik sadly. \"My brother came to\\r\\ncut thy bonds and set thee free, but thou set upon him and then came\\r\\nel-fil and carried thee away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what meant thy brother when he raised his knife and cried: \\'Die,\\r\\nNasrany!\\'\" demanded the ape-man. \"Sayeth a man thus who cometh to do a\\r\\nkindness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did but joke,\" mumbled Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here again,\" said Tarzan, \"but not to joke. My Waziri are coming.\\r\\nTogether we shall see you well on your way toward the desert.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is what we wish,\" said the sheik quickly. \"Ask this other Nasrany\\r\\nif it be not true that we are lost and would be but too glad to have\\r\\nthee lead us upon the right way. Here we be beset by Galla warriors.\\r\\nTheir chief hath been gathering them for days and momentarily we fear\\r\\nthat we shall be attacked. Is that not true, Nasrany?\" he turned to\\r\\nStimbol as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is true,\" said Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true that you are going to leave the country,\" said Tarzan, \"and\\r\\nI shall remain to see that you do so. Tomorrow you will start. In the\\r\\nmeantime set aside a beyt for me--and let there be no more treachery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou needst fear nothing,\" Ibn Jad assured him, then he turned his\\r\\nface toward the women\\'s quarters. \"Hirfa! Ateja!\" he called. \"Make\\r\\nready the beyt of Zeyd for the sheykh of the jungle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo one side but at no great distance from the beyt of Ibn Jad the two\\r\\nwomen raised the black tent for Tarzan, and when the am\\'dan had been\\r\\nplaced and straightened and the tunb el-beyt made fast to the pegs that\\r\\nAteja drove into the earth Hirfa returned to her household duties,\\r\\nleaving her daughter to stretch the side curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instant that Hirfa was out of ear shot Ateja ran to Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Nasrany,\" she cried, \"thou hast seen my Zeyd? He is safe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I left him in a village where the chief will care for him until such\\r\\ntime as thy people come upon thy return to the desert country. He is\\r\\nquite safe and well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me of him, oh, Nasrany, for my heart hungers for word of him,\"\\r\\nimplored the girl. \"How came you upon him? Where was he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His mare had been dragged down by el-adrea who was about to devour\\r\\nyour lover. I chanced to be there and slew el-adrea. Then I took Zeyd\\r\\nto the village of a chief who is my friend, for I knew that he could\\r\\nnot survive the perils of the jungle should I leave him afoot and\\r\\nalone. It was my thought to send him from the country in safety, but he\\r\\nbegged to remain until you returned that way. This I have permitted. In\\r\\na few weeks you will see your lover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTears were falling from Ateja\\'s long, black lashes--tears of joy--as\\r\\nshe seized Tarzan\\'s hand and kissed it. \"My life is thine, Nasrany,\"\\r\\nshe cried, \"for that thou hast given me back my lover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night as the Galla slave, Fejjuan, walked through the menzil of\\r\\nhis masters he saw Ibn Jad and Tollog sitting in the sheik\\'s mukaad\\r\\nwhispering together and Fejjuan, well aware of the inherent turpitude\\r\\nof this precious pair, wondered what might be the nature of their\\r\\nplotting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the curtain of the hareem Ateja lay huddled upon her sleeping\\r\\nmat, but she did not sleep. Instead she was listening to the whispered\\r\\nconversation of her father and her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be put out of the way,\" Ibn Jad insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But his Waziri are coming,\" objected Tollog. \"If they do not find him\\r\\nhere what can we say? They will not believe us, whatever we say. They\\r\\nwill set upon us. I have heard that they are terrible men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah!\" cried Ibn Jad. \"If he stays we are undone. Better risk\\r\\nsomething than to return empty handed to our own country after all that\\r\\nwe have passed through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If thou thinkest that I shall again take this business upon myself\\r\\nthou art mistaken, brother,\" said Tollog. \"Once was enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not thee; but we must find a way. Is there none among us who might\\r\\nwish more than another to be rid of the Nasrany?\" asked Ibn Jad, but to\\r\\nhimself as though he were thinking aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other Nasrany!\" exclaimed Tollog. \"He hateth him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad clapped his hands together. \"Thou hast it, brother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But still shall we be held responsible,\" reminded Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What matter if he be out of the way. We can be no worse off than we\\r\\nnow are. Suppose Batando came tomorrow with the guides? Then indeed\\r\\nwould the jungle sheykh know that we have lied to him, and it might go\\r\\nhard with us. No, we must be rid of him this very night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but how?\" asked Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold! I have a plan. Listen well, O brother!\" and Ibn Jad rubbed his\\r\\npalms together and smiled, but he would not have smiled, perhaps had he\\r\\nknown that Ateja listened, or had he seen the silent figure crouching\\r\\nin the dark just beyond the outer curtain of his beyt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak, Ibn Jad,\" urged Tollog, \"tell me thy plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, it is known by all that the Nasrany Stimbol hates the sheykh\\r\\nof the jungle. With loud tongue he hath proclaimed it many times before\\r\\nall when many were gathered in my mukaad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would send Stimbol to slay Tarzan of the Apes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou guessed aright,\" admitted Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how wilt that relieve us of responsibility? He wilt have been\\r\\nslain by thy order in thine own menzil,\" objected Tollog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait! I shall not command the one Nasrany to slay the other; I shall\\r\\nbut suggest it, and when it is done I shall be filled with rage and\\r\\nhorror that this murder hath been done in my menzil. And to prove\\r\\nmy good faith I shall order that the murderer be put to death in\\r\\npunishment for his crime. Thus we shall be rid of two unbelieving\\r\\ndogs and at the same time be able to convince the Waziri that we were\\r\\nindeed the friends of their sheykh, for we shall mourn him with loud\\r\\nlamentations--when the Waziri shall have arrived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Allah be praised for such a brother!\" exclaimed Tollog, enraptured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go thou now, at once, and summon the Nasrany Stimbol,\" directed Ibn\\r\\nJad. \"Send him to me alone, and after I have spoken with him and he\\r\\nhath departed upon his errand come thee back to my beyt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja trembled upon her sleeping mat, while the silent figure\\r\\ncrouching outside the sheik\\'s tent arose after Tollog had departed and\\r\\ndisappeared in the darkness of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHastily summoned from the beyt of Fahd, Stimbol, cautioned to stealth\\r\\nby Tollog, moved silently through the darkness to the mukaad of the\\r\\nsheik, where he found Ibn Jad awaiting him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit, Nasrany,\" invited the Beduin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What in hell do you want of me this time of night?\" demanded Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been talking with Tarzan of the Apes,\" said Ibn Jad, \"and\\r\\nbecause you are my friend and he is not I have sent for you to tell\\r\\nyou what he plans for you. He has interfered in all my designs and is\\r\\ndriving me from the country, but that is as nothing compared with what\\r\\nhe intends for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What in hell is he up to now?\" demanded Stimbol. \"He\\'s always butting\\r\\ninto some one else\\'s business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou dost not like him?\" asked Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should I?\" and Stimbol applied a vile epithet to Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou wilt like him less when I tell thee,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, tell me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says that thou hast slain thy companion, Blake,\" explained the\\r\\nsheik, \"and for that Tarzan is going to kill thee on the morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh? What? Kill me?\" demanded Stimbol. \"Why he can\\'t do it! What does\\r\\nhe think he is--a Roman emperor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nevertheless he will do as he says,\" insisted Ibn Jad. \"He is all\\r\\npowerful here. No one questions the acts of this great jungle sheykh.\\r\\nTomorrow he will kill thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--you won\\'t let him, Ibn Jad! Surely, you won\\'t let him?\" Stimbol\\r\\nwas already trembling with terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad elevated his palms. \"What can I do?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can--you can--why there must be something that you can do,\" wailed\\r\\nthe frightened man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is naught that any can do--save yourself,\" whispered the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lies asleep in yon beyt and--thou hast a sharp khusa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never killed a man,\" whimpered Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor hast thou ever been killed,\" reminded the sheik; \"but tonight thou\\r\\nmust kill or tomorrow thou wilt be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God!\" gasped Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is late,\" said Ibn Jad, \"and I go to my sleeping mat. I have warned\\r\\nthee--do what thou wilt in the matter,\" and he arose as though to enter\\r\\nthe woman\\'s quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrembling, Stimbol staggered out into the night. For a moment he\\r\\nhesitated, then he crouched and crept silently through the darkness\\r\\ntoward the beyt that had been erected for the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ahead of him ran Ateja to warn the man who had saved her lover\\r\\nfrom the fangs of el-adrea. She was almost at the beyt she had helped\\r\\nto erect for the ape-man when a figure stepped from another tent and\\r\\nclapping a palm across her mouth and an arm about her waist held her\\r\\nfirmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where goest thou?\" whispered a voice in her ear, a voice that she\\r\\nrecognized at once as belonging to her uncle; but Tollog did not wait\\r\\nfor a reply, he answered for her. \"Thou goest to warn the Nasrany\\r\\nbecause he befriended thy lover! Get thee back to thy father\\'s beyt. If\\r\\nhe knew this he would slay thee. Go!\" And he gave her a great shove in\\r\\nthe direction from which she had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a nasty smile upon Tollog\\'s lips as he thought how neatly he\\r\\nhad foiled the girl, and he thanked Allah that chance had placed him\\r\\nin a position to intercept her before she had been able to ruin them\\r\\nall; and even as Tollog, the brother of the sheik, smiled in his beard\\r\\na hand reached out of the darkness behind him and seized him by the\\r\\nthroat--fingers grasped him and dragged him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrembling, bathed in cold sweat, grasping in tightly clenched fingers\\r\\nthe hilt of a keen knife, Wilbur Stimbol crept through the darkness\\r\\ntoward the tent of his victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol had been an irritable man, a bully and a coward; but he\\r\\nwas no criminal. Every fiber of his being revolted at the thing he\\r\\ncontemplated. He did not want to kill, but he was a cornered human rat\\r\\nand he thought that death stared him in the face, leaving open only\\r\\nthis one way of escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he entered the beyt of the ape-man he steeled himself to accomplish\\r\\nthat for which he had come, and he was indeed a very dangerous, a very\\r\\nformidable man, as he crept to the side of the figure lying in the\\r\\ndarkness, wrapped in an old burnous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _Sword and Buckler_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sun touched the turrets of the castle of the Prince of Nimmr a\\r\\nyouth rolled from between his blankets, rubbed his eyes and stretched.\\r\\nThen he reached over and shook another youth of about his own age who\\r\\nslept beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Awaken, Edward! Awaken, thou sluggard!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward rolled over on his back and essayed to say \"Eh?\" and to yawn at\\r\\nthe same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up, lad!\" urged Michel. \"Forgottest thou that thy master fares forth\\r\\nto be slain this day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward sat up, now fully awake. His eyes flashed. \"\\'Tis a lie!\" he\\r\\ncried, loyally. \"He will cleave Sir Malud from poll to breast plate\\r\\nwith a single blow. Livest no sir knight with such mighty thews as hast\\r\\nSir James. Thou art disloyal, Michel, to Sir Richard\\'s friend who hath\\r\\nbeen a good and kindly friend to us as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel patted the other lad upon the shoulder. \"Nay, I did but jest,\\r\\nEdward,\" he said. \"My hopes be all for Sir James, and yet----\" he\\r\\npaused, \"I fear----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fear what?\" demanded Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Sir James be not well enough versed in the use of sword and\\r\\nbuckler to overcome Sir Malud, for even were his strength the strength\\r\\nof ten men it shall avail him naught without the skill to use it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shalt see!\" maintained Edward, stoutly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that Sir James hath a loyal squire,\" said a voice behind them,\\r\\nand turning they saw Sir Richard standing in the doorway, \"and may all\\r\\nhis friends wish him well this day thus loyally!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fell asleep last night praying to our Lord Jesus to guide his blade\\r\\nthrough Sir Malud\\'s helm,\" said Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good! Get thee up now and look to thy master\\'s mail and to the\\r\\ntrappings of his steed, that he may enter the lists bedight as befits a\\r\\nnoble sir knight of Nimmr,\" instructed Richard, and left them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was eleven o\\'clock of this February morning. The sun shone down\\r\\ninto the great north ballium of the castle of Nimmr, glinting from\\r\\nthe polished mail of noble knights and from pike and battle-axe of\\r\\nmen-at-arms, picking out the gay colors of the robes of the women\\r\\ngathered in the grandstand below the inner wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon a raised dais at the front and center of the grandstand sat Prince\\r\\nGobred and his party, and upon either side of them and extending to\\r\\nthe far ends of the stand were ranged the noble knights and ladies of\\r\\nNimmr, while behind them sat men-at-arms who were off duty, then the\\r\\nfreedmen and, last of all, the serfs, for under the beneficent rule of\\r\\nthe house of Gobred these were accorded many privileges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt either end of the lists was a tent, gay with pennons and the colors\\r\\nand devices of its owner; one with the green and gold of Sir Malud and\\r\\nthe other with the blue and silver of Sir James.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore each of these tilts stood two men-at-arms, resplendent in new\\r\\napparel, the metal of their battle-axes gleaming brightly, and here a\\r\\ngroom held a restive, richly caparisoned charger, while the squire of\\r\\neach of the contestants busied himself with last-minute preparations\\r\\nfor the encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nA trumpeter, statuesque, the bell of his trumpet resting upon his hip,\\r\\nwaited for the signal to sound the fanfare that would announce the\\r\\nentrance of his master into the lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few yards to the rear a second charger champed upon his bit as he\\r\\nnuzzled the groom that held him in waiting for the knight who would\\r\\naccompany each of the contestants upon the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the blue and silver tilt sat Blake and Sir Richard, the latter\\r\\nissuing instructions and advice, and of the two he was the more\\r\\nnervous. Blake\\'s hauberk, gorget and bassinet were of heavy chain mail,\\r\\nthe latter lined inside and covered outside, down to the gorget, with\\r\\nleopard skin, offering fair protection for his head from an ordinary,\\r\\nglancing blow; upon his breast was sewn a large, red cross and from one\\r\\nshoulder depended the streamers of a blue and silver rosette. Hanging\\r\\nfrom the pole of the tilt, upon a wooden peg, were Blake\\'s sword and\\r\\nbuckler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grandstand was filled. Prince Gobred glanced up at the sun and\\r\\nspoke to a knight at his side. The latter gave a brief command to\\r\\na trumpeter stationed at the princely loge and presently, loud and\\r\\nclear, the notes of a trumpet rang in the ballium. Instantly the tilts\\r\\nat either end of the lists were galvanized to activity, while the\\r\\ngrandstand seemed to spring to new life as necks were craned first\\r\\ntoward the tent of Sir Malud and then toward that of Sir James.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward, flushed with excitement, ran into the tilt and seizing Blake\\'s\\r\\nsword passed the girdle about his hips and buckled it in place at his\\r\\nleft side, then, with the buckler, he followed his master out of the\\r\\ntilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Blake prepared to mount Edward held his stirrup while the groom\\r\\nsought to quiet the nervous horse. The lad pressed Blake\\'s leg after he\\r\\nhad swung into the saddle (no light accomplishment, weighed down as he\\r\\nwas by heavy chain mail) and looked up into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have prayed for thee, Sir James,\" he said. \"I know that thou wilt\\r\\nprevail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake saw tears in the youth\\'s eyes as he looked down at him and he\\r\\ncaught a choking note in his voice. \"You\\'re a good boy, Eddie,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"I\\'ll promise that you won\\'t have to be ashamed of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Sir James, how could I? Even in death thou wilt be a noble figure\\r\\nof a knight. An fairer one it hath never been given one to see,\\r\\nmethinks,\" Edward assured him as he handed him his round buckler.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Richard had by now mounted, and at a signal from him that they were\\r\\nready there was a fanfare from the trumpet at Sir Malud\\'s tilt and that\\r\\nnoble sir knight rode forward, followed by a single knight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake\\'s trumpeter now announced his master\\'s entry and the American\\r\\nrode out close along the front of the grandstand, followed by Sir\\r\\nRichard. There was a murmur of applause for each contestant, which\\r\\nincreased as they advanced and met before Prince Gobred\\'s loge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the four knights reined in and faced the Prince and each raised\\r\\nthe hilt of his sword to his lips and kissed it in salute. As Gobred\\r\\ncautioned them to fight honorably, as true knights, and reminded them\\r\\nof the rules governing the encounter Blake\\'s eyes wandered to the face\\r\\nof Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little princess sat stiffly erect, looking straight before her. She\\r\\nseemed very white, Blake thought, and he wondered if she were ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow beautiful, thought Blake, and though she did not once appear to\\r\\nlook at him he was not cast down, for neither did she look at Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the trumpet sounded and the four knights rode slowly back to\\r\\nopposite ends of the lists and the principals waited for the final\\r\\nsignal to engage. Blake disengaged his arm from the leather loop of his\\r\\nbuckler and tossed the shield upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward looked at him aghast. \"My Lord knight!\" he cried. \"Art ill? Art\\r\\nfainting? Didst drop thy buckler?\" and he snatched it up and held it\\r\\naloft to Blake, though he knew full well that his eyes had not deceived\\r\\nhim and that his master had cast aside his only protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the horrified Edward there seemed but one explanation and that his\\r\\nloyalty would not permit him to entertain for an instant--that Blake\\r\\nwas preparing to dismount and refuse to meet Sir Malud, giving the\\r\\nlatter the victory by default and assuring himself of the contempt and\\r\\nridicule of all Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ran to Richard who had not seen Blake\\'s act. \"Sir Richard! Sir\\r\\nRichard!\" he cried in a hoarse whisper. \"Some terrible affliction hath\\r\\nbefallen Sir James!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, what?\" exclaimed Richard. \"What meaneth thou lad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has cast aside his buckler,\" cried the youth. \"He must be stricken\\r\\nsore ill, for it cannot be that otherwise he would refuse combat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard spurred to Blake\\'s side. \"Hast gone mad, man?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\"Thou canst not refuse the encounter now unless thou wouldst bring\\r\\ndishonor upon thy friends!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you get that line?\" demanded Blake. \"Who said I was going to\\r\\nquit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But thy buckler?\" cried Sir Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trumpet at the Prince\\'s loge rang out peremptorily. Sir Malud\\r\\nspurred forward to a fanfare from his own trumpeter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her go!\" cried Blake to his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy buckler!\" screamed Sir Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The damned thing was in my way,\" shouted Blake as he spurred forward\\r\\nto meet the doughty Malud, Richard trailing behind him, as did Malud\\'s\\r\\nsecond behind that knight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a confident smile upon the lips of Sir Malud and he glanced\\r\\noften at the knights and ladies in the grandstand, but Blake rode with\\r\\nhis eyes always upon his antagonist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth horses had broken immediately into a gallop, and as they neared\\r\\none another Malud spurred forward at a run and Blake saw that the man\\'s\\r\\naim was doubtless to overthrow him at the first impact, or at least to\\r\\nso throw him out of balance as to make it easy for Malud to strike a\\r\\ngood blow before he could recover himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalud rode with his sword half raised at his right side, while Blake\\'s\\r\\nwas at guard, a position unknown to the knights of Nimmr, who guarded\\r\\nsolely with their bucklers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horsemen approached to engage upon each other\\'s left, and as they\\r\\nwere about to meet Sir Malud rose in his stirrups and swung his sword\\r\\nhand down, to gain momentum, described a circle with his blade and\\r\\nlaunched a terrific cut at Blake\\'s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at that instant that some few in the grandstand realized that\\r\\nBlake bore no buckler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His buckler!\" \"Sir James hath no buckler!\" \"He hath lost his buckler!\"\\r\\nrose now from all parts of the stand; and from right beside him, where\\r\\nthe two knights met before the loge of Gobred, Blake heard a woman\\r\\nscream, but he could not look to see if it were Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they met Blake reined his horse suddenly toward Malud\\'s, so that\\r\\nthe two chargers\\' shoulders struck, and at the same time he cast all\\r\\nhis weight in the same direction, whereas Malud, who was standing in\\r\\nhis stirrups to deliver his blow, was almost in a state of equilibrium\\r\\nand having his buckler ready for defense was quite helpless insofar as\\r\\nmaneuvering his mount was concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalud, overbalanced, lost the force and changed the direction of his\\r\\nblow, which fell, much to the knight\\'s surprise, upon Blake\\'s blade\\r\\nalong which it spent its force and was deflected from its target.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly, his horse well in hand by reason that his left arm was\\r\\nunencumbered by a buckler, Blake reined in and simultaneously cut to\\r\\nthe left and rear, his point opening the mail on Malud\\'s left shoulder\\r\\nand biting into the flesh before the latter\\'s horse had carried him out\\r\\nof reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nA loud shout of approbation arose from the stands for the thing had\\r\\nbeen neatly done and then Malud\\'s second spurred to the Prince\\'s loge\\r\\nand entered a protest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir James hath no buckler!\" he cried. \"\\'Tis no fair combat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis fairer for thy knight than for Sir James,\" said Gobred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We would not take that advantage of him,\" parried Malud\\'s second, Sir\\r\\nJarred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sayest thou?\" demanded Gobred of Sir Richard who had quickly\\r\\nridden to Jarred\\'s side. \"Is Sir James without a buckler through some\\r\\naccident that befell before he entered the lists?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, he cast it aside,\" replied Richard, \"and averred that the \\'damned\\r\\nthing\\' did annoy him; but if Sir Jarred feeleth that, because of this,\\r\\nthey be not fairly matched we are willing that Sir Malud, also, should\\r\\ncast aside his buckler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGobred smiled. \"That be fair,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men, concerned with their encounter and not with the argument\\r\\nof their seconds, had engaged once more. Blood was showing upon Malud\\'s\\r\\nshoulder and trickling down his back, staining his skirts and the\\r\\nhousing of his charger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stand was in an uproar, for many were still shouting aloud about\\r\\nthe buckler and others were screaming with delight over the neat\\r\\nmanner in which Sir James had drawn his first blood. Wagers were being\\r\\nfreely made, and though Sir Malud still ruled favorite in the betting,\\r\\nthe odds against Blake were not so great, and while men had no money to\\r\\nwager they had jewels and arms and horses. One enthusiastic adherent\\r\\nof Sir Malud bet three chargers against one that his champion would\\r\\nbe victorious and the words were scarce out of his mouth ere he had a\\r\\ndozen takers, whereas before the opening passage at arms offers as high\\r\\nas ten to one had found no takers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the smile was gone from Malud\\'s lips and he glanced no more at\\r\\nthe grandstand. There was rage in his eyes as he spurred again toward\\r\\nBlake, who he thought had profited by a lucky accident.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnhampered by a buckler Blake took full advantage of the nimbleness of\\r\\nthe wiry horse he rode and which he had ridden daily since his arrival\\r\\nin Nimmr, so that man and beast were well accustomed to one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Sir Malud saw his blade glance harmlessly from the sword of his\\r\\nantagonist and then, to his vast surprise, the point of Sir James\\'\\r\\nblade leaped quickly beneath his buckler and entered his side. It was\\r\\nnot a deep wound, but it was painful and again it brought blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngrily Malud struck again, but Blake had reined his charger quickly to\\r\\nthe rear and before Malud could gather his reins Blake had struck him\\r\\nagain, this time a heavy blow upon the helm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf stunned and wholly infuriated Malud wheeled and charged at full\\r\\ntilt, once again determined to ride his adversary down. They met with\\r\\na crash directly in front of Gobred\\'s loge, there was a quick play of\\r\\nswords that baffled the eyesight of the onlookers and then, to the\\r\\nastonishment of all, most particularly Malud, that noble sir knight\\'s\\r\\nsword flew from his grasp and hurtled to the field, leaving him\\r\\nentirely to the mercy of his foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalud reined in and sat erect, waiting. He knew and Blake knew that\\r\\nunder the rules that governed their encounter Blake was warranted in\\r\\nrunning him through unless Malud sued for mercy, and no one, Blake\\r\\nleast of all, expected this of so proud and haughty a knight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Malud sat proudly on his charger waiting for Blake to advance\\r\\nand kill him. Utter silence had fallen upon the stands, so that the\\r\\nchamping of Malud\\'s horse upon its bit was plainly audible. Blake\\r\\nturned to Sir Jarred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Summon a squire, sir knight,\" he said, \"to return Sir Malud\\'s sword to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the stands rocked to the applause, but Blake turned his back upon\\r\\nthem and rode to Richard\\'s side to wait until his adversary was again\\r\\narmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, old top,\" he inquired of Sir Richard, \"just how much a dozen am\\r\\nI offered for bucklers now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard laughed. \"Thou hast been passing fortunate, James,\" he replied;\\r\\n\"but methinks a good swordsman would long since have cut thee through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know Malud would have if I had packed that chopping bowl along on\\r\\nthe party,\" Blake assured him, though it is doubtful if Sir Richard\\r\\nunderstood what he was talking about, as was so often the case when\\r\\nBlake discoursed that Richard had long since ceased to even speculate\\r\\nas to the meaning of much that his friend said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now Sir Malud was rearmed and riding toward Blake. He stopped his\\r\\nhorse before the American and bowed low. \"I do my devoirs to a noble\\r\\nand generous knight,\" he said, graciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake bowed. \"Are you ready sir?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalud nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On guard, then!\" snapped the American.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment the two jockeyed for position. Blake feinted and Malud\\r\\nraised his buckler before his face to catch the blow, but as it did not\\r\\nfall he lowered his shield, just as Blake had known that he would, and\\r\\nas he did so the edge of the American\\'s weapon fell heavily upon the\\r\\ncrown of his bassinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalud\\'s arm dropped at his side, he slumped in his saddle and then\\r\\ntoppled forward and rolled to the ground. Agile, even in his heavy\\r\\narmor, Blake dismounted and walked to where his foe lay stretched upon\\r\\nhis back almost in front of Gobred\\'s loge. He placed a foot upon\\r\\nMalud\\'s breast and pressed the point of his sword against his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd leaned forward to see the coup-de-grace administered, but\\r\\nBlake did not drive his point home. He looked up at Prince Gobred and\\r\\naddressed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a brave knight,\" he said, \"with whom I have no real quarrel.\\r\\nI spare him to your service, Prince, and to those who love him,\" and\\r\\nhis eyes went straight to the eyes of the Princess Guinalda. Then he\\r\\nturned and walked back along the front of the grandstand to his own\\r\\ntilt, while Richard rode behind him, and the knights and the ladies,\\r\\nthe men-at-arms, the freedmen and the serfs stood upon their seats and\\r\\nshouted their applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was beside himself with joy, as was Michel. The former knelt and\\r\\nembraced Blake\\'s legs, he kissed his hand, and wept, so great were his\\r\\nhappiness and his excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\" he cried. \"Didst I not tell thee, Michel, that\\r\\nmy own sir knight would overthrow Sir Malud?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men-at-arms, the trumpeter and the grooms at Blake\\'s tilt wore\\r\\ngrins that stretched from ear to ear. Whereas a few minutes before they\\r\\nhad felt ashamed to have been detailed to the losing side, now they\\r\\nwere most proud and looked upon Blake as the greatest hero of Nimmr.\\r\\nGreat would be their boasting among their fellows as they gathered\\r\\nwith their flagons of ale about the rough deal table in their dining\\r\\nhall.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward removed Blake\\'s armor and Michel got Richard out of his amidst\\r\\nmuch babbling upon the part of the youths who could not contain\\r\\nthemselves, so doubly great was their joy because so unexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake went directly to his quarters and Richard accompanied him, and\\r\\nwhen the two men were alone Richard placed a hand upon Blake\\'s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou hast done a noble and chivalrous thing, my friend,\" he said, \"but\\r\\nI know not that it be a wise one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\" demanded Blake. \"You didn\\'t think I could stick the poor\\r\\nmutt when he was lying there defenseless?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard shook his head. \"\\'Tis but what he would have done for thee had\\r\\nthy positions been reversed,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I couldn\\'t do it. We\\'re not taught to believe that it is exactly\\r\\nethical to hit a fellow when he\\'s down, where I come from,\" explained\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had your quarrel been no deeper than appeared upon the surface thou\\r\\nmight well have been thus magnanimous; but Malud be jealous of thee and\\r\\nthat jealousy will be by no means lessened by what hath transpired this\\r\\nday. Thou might have been rid of a powerful and dangerous enemy had\\r\\nthou given him the coup-de-grace, as was thy right; but now thou hast\\r\\nraised up a greater enemy since to his jealousy is added hatred and\\r\\nenvy against thee for thy prowess over him. Thou didst make him appear\\r\\nlike a monkey, James, and that Sir Malud wilt never forgive, and I know\\r\\nthe man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knights and ladies attached to the castle of Gobred ate together\\r\\nat a great table in the huge hall of the castle. Three hundred people\\r\\ncould be accommodated at the single board and it took quite a company\\r\\nof serving men to fill their needs. Whole pigs, roasted, were carried\\r\\nin upon great trenchers and there were legs of mutton and sides of\\r\\nvenison and bowls of vegetables, with wine and ale, and at the end\\r\\nimmense puddings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much laughter and loud talking, and it all presented a wild\\r\\nand fascinating picture to Sir James Blake as he sat at the lower end\\r\\nof the table far below the salt that night, in his accustomed place as\\r\\none of the latest neophytes in the noble ranks of the knighthood of\\r\\nNimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe encounter between himself and Malud was the subject of the\\r\\nmoment and many were the compliments bestowed upon him and many the\\r\\nquestions as to where and how he had acquired his strange technique of\\r\\nswordsmanship. Although they had seen him accomplish it, yet they still\\r\\nappeared to believe it inconceivable that a man might prevail without a\\r\\nbuckler over one who carried this essential article of defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Gobred and his family sat, with the higher nobles of Nimmr, at\\r\\na table slightly raised above the rest of the board and running across\\r\\nits upper end, the whole forming a huge T. When he wished to speak to\\r\\nanyone farther down the table he resorted to the simple expedient of\\r\\nraising his voice, so that if several were so inclined at the same time\\r\\nthe room became a bedlam for uproar and confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Blake sat at the farthest end of the table it was necessary for\\r\\none at Gobred\\'s end to scream to attract attention, though when it was\\r\\ndiscovered that it was the prince who was speaking the rest of the\\r\\ncompany usually lapsed into silence out of respect for him, unless they\\r\\nwere too far gone in drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the feasters were seated Gobred had arisen and lifted his\\r\\ngoblet high in air, and silence had fallen upon the whole company as\\r\\nknights and ladies rose and faced their prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hal to our King!\" cried Gobred. \"Hal to our liege lord, Richard of\\r\\nEngland!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in a great chorus rose the answering \"Hal!\" as the company drank\\r\\nthe health of Richard Coeur de Lion seven hundred and twenty-eight\\r\\nyears after his death!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they drank the health of Gobred and of the Princess Brynilda, his\\r\\nwife, and of the Princess Guinalda, and each time a voice boomed from\\r\\njust below the dais of the prince: \"Here I be looking at thee!\" as Sir\\r\\nRichard with a proud smile displayed his newly acquired knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Prince Gobred arose. \"Hal!\" he cried, \"to that worthy sir knight\\r\\nwho hath most nobly and chivalrously acquitted himself in the lists\\r\\nthis day! Hal to Sir James, Knight Templar and, now, Knight of Nimmr!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot even the name of Richard I of England had aroused the enthusiasm\\r\\nthat followed the drinking to Sir James. The length of the long hall\\r\\nBlake\\'s eyes travelled straight to where Guinalda stood. He saw her\\r\\ndrink to him and he saw that her eyes were regarding him, but the\\r\\ndistance was too great and the light of the pitch torches and the oil\\r\\ncressets too dim for him to see whether her glance carried a message of\\r\\nfriendship or dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the noise had partially subsided and the drinkers had retaken\\r\\ntheir seats Blake arose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prince Gobred,\" he called the length of the room, \"knights and ladies\\r\\nof Nimmr, I give you another toast! To Sir Malud!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment there was silence, the silence of surprise, and then the\\r\\ncompany arose and drank the health of the absent Sir Malud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou are a strange sir knight, with strange words upon thy lips and\\r\\nstrange ways, Sir James,\" shouted Gobred, \"but though thou callest\\r\\na hal \\'a toast\\' and thy friends be \\'old top\\' and \\'kid,\\' yet withal\\r\\nit seemeth that we understand thee and we would know more about thy\\r\\ncountry and the ways of the noble knights that do abide there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell us, are they all thus chivalrous and magnanimous to their fallen\\r\\nfoes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they\\'re not they get the raspberry,\" explained Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Get the raspberry\\'!\" repeated Gobred. \"\\'Tis some form of punishment,\\r\\nmethinks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said it, Prince!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of a surety I said it, Sir James!\" snapped Gobred with asperity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, Prince, that you hit the nail on the head--you guessed it the\\r\\nfirst time. You see the raspberry is about the only form of punishment\\r\\nthat the Knights of the Squared Circle, or the Knights of the Diamond\\r\\ncan understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Knights of the Squared Circle\\'! \\'Knights of the Diamond\\'! Those be\\r\\nknightly orders of which I wot not. Be they doughty knights?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them are dotty, but a lot of them are regulars. Take Sir\\r\\nDempsey, for instance, a knight of the Squared Circle. He showed \\'em\\r\\nall he was a regular knight in defeat, which is much more difficult\\r\\nthan being a regular knight in victory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be there other orders of knighthood these days?\" demanded Gobred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re lousy with them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried Gobred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re all knights these days,\" explained Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All knights! Be there no serfs nor yeomen? \\'Tis incredible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there are some yeomen in the navy, I think; but all the rest\\r\\nof us, pretty much, are knights. You see things have changed a lot\\r\\nsince the days of Richard. The people have sort of overthrown the old\\r\\norder of things. They poked a lot of ridicule at knights and wanted\\r\\nto get rid of knighthood, and as soon as they had they all wanted to\\r\\nbe knights themselves; so we have Knights Templar now and Knights of\\r\\nPythias and Knights of Columbus and Knights of Labor and a lot more I\\r\\ncan\\'t recall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Methinks it must be a fine and noble world,\" cried Gobred, \"for what\\r\\nwith so many noble sir knights it would seemeth that they must often\\r\\ncontend, one against another--is that not true?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, they do scrap some,\" Blake admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _The Lonely Grave_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the dark interior of the beyt Stimbol could see nothing. Just\\r\\nbefore him he heard a man breathing heavily as might one in a troubled\\r\\nsleep. The would-be murderer paused to steady his nerves. Then, on\\r\\nhands and knees, he crept forward inch by inch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently one of his hands touched the prostrate figure of the sleeper.\\r\\nLightly, cautiously, Stimbol groped until he had definitely discovered\\r\\nthe position in which his victim lay. In one hand, ready, he grasped\\r\\nthe keen knife. He scarce dared breathe for fear he might awaken the\\r\\nape-man. He prayed that Tarzan was a sound sleeper, and he prayed that\\r\\nthe first blow of his weapon would reach that savage heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow he was ready! He had located the exact spot where he must strike!\\r\\nHe raised his knife and struck. His victim shuddered spasmodically.\\r\\nAgain and again with savage maniacal force and speed the knife was\\r\\nplunged into the soft flesh. Stimbol felt the warm blood spurt out\\r\\nupon his hand and wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, satisfied that his mission had been accomplished, he\\r\\nscurried from the beyt. Now he was trembling so that he could scarcely\\r\\nstand--terrified, revolted by the horrid crime he had committed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWild-eyed, haggard, he stumbled to the mukaad of Ibn Jad\\'s beyt and\\r\\nthere he collapsed. The sheik stepped from the women\\'s quarters and\\r\\nlooked down upon the trembling figure that the dim light of a paper\\r\\nlantern revealed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What doest thou here, Nasrany?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have done it, Ibn Jad!\" muttered Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done what?\" cried the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Slain Tarzan of the Apes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ai! Ai!\" screamed Ibn Jad. \"Tollog! Where art thou? Hirfa! Ateja!\\r\\nCome! Didst hear what the Nasrany sayeth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHirfa and Ateja rushed into the mukaad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didst hear him?\" repeated Ibn Jad. \"He hath slain my good friend the\\r\\ngreat sheykh of the Jungle. Motlog! Fahd! Haste!\" His voice had been\\r\\nrising until now he was screaming at the top of his lungs and \\'Aarab\\r\\nwere streaming toward his beyt from all directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, stunned by what he had done, dumb from surprise and terror at\\r\\nthe unexpected attitude of Ibn Jad, crouched speechless in the center\\r\\nof the mukaad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seize him!\" cried the sheik to the first man that arrived. \"He hath\\r\\nslain Tarzan of the Apes, our great friend, who was to preserve us and\\r\\nlead us from this land of dangers. Now all wilt be our enemies. The\\r\\nfriends of Tarzan wilt fall upon us and slay us. Allah, bear witness\\r\\nthat I be free from guilt in this matter and let Thy wrath and the\\r\\nwrath of the friends of Tarzan fall upon this guilty man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the entire population of the menzil was gathered in front\\r\\nof the sheik\\'s beyt, and if they were surprised by his protestations of\\r\\nsudden affection for Tarzan they gave no evidence of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take him away!\" commanded Ibn Jad. \"In the morning we shall gather and\\r\\ndecide what we must do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dragged the terrified Stimbol to Fahd\\'s beyt, where they bound him\\r\\nhand and foot and left him for Fahd to guard. When they had gone the\\r\\nBeduin leaned low over Stimbol, and whispered in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didst really slay the jungle sheykh?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ibn Jad forced me to do so and now he turns against me,\" whimpered\\r\\nStimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And tomorrow he will have you killed so that he may tell the friends\\r\\nof Tarzan that he hath punished the slayer of Tarzan,\" said Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Save me, Fahd!\" begged Stimbol. \"Save me and I will give you twenty\\r\\nmillion francs--I swear it! Once I am safe in the nearest European\\r\\ncolony I will get the money for you. Think of it, Fahd--twenty million\\r\\nfrancs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of it, Nasrany,\" replied the Beduin, \"and I think that\\r\\nthou liest. There be not that much money in the world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I swear that I have ten times that amount. If I have lied to you you\\r\\nmay kill me. Save me! Save me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty million francs!\" murmured Fahd. \"Perchance he does not lie!\\r\\nListen, Nasrany. I do not know that I can save thee, but I shall try,\\r\\nand if I succeed and thou forgettest the twenty million francs I shall\\r\\nkill thee if I have to follow thee across the world--dost understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad called two ignorant slaves to him and commanded them to go to\\r\\nthe beyt that had been Zeyd\\'s and carry Tarzan\\'s body to the edge of\\r\\nthe menzil where they were to dig a grave and bury it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith paper lanterns they went to the beyt of death and wrapping the\\r\\ndead man in the old burnous that already covered him they carried him\\r\\nacross the menzil and laid him down while they dug a shallow grave;\\r\\nand so, beneath a forest giant in the land that he loved the grave of\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly the slaves rolled the corpse into the hole they had made,\\r\\nshovelled the dirt upon it and left it in its lonely, unmarked tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning Ibn Jad called about him the elders of the\\r\\ntribe, and when they were gathered it was noted that Tollog was\\r\\nmissing, and though a search was made he could not be found. Fahd\\r\\nsuggested that he had gone forth early to hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad explained to them that if they were to escape the wrath of the\\r\\nfriends of Tarzan they must take immediate steps to disprove their\\r\\nresponsibility for the slaying of the ape-man and that they might only\\r\\ndo this and express their good faith by punishing the murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not difficult to persuade them to take the life of a Christian\\r\\nand there was only one that demurred. This was Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are two reasons, Ibn Jad, why we should not take the life of\\r\\nthis Nasrany,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah, there never be any reason why a true believer should not\\r\\ntake the life of a Nasrany!\" cried one of the old men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen,\" admonished Fahd, \"to what I have in mind and then I am sure\\r\\nthat you will agree that I am right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak, Fahd,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This Nasrany is a rich and powerful man in his own beled. If it be\\r\\npossible to spare his life he will command a great ransom--dead he is\\r\\nworth nothing to us. If by chance, the friends of Tarzan do not learn\\r\\nof his death before we are safely out of this accursed land it will\\r\\nhave profited us naught to have killed Stimbol and, billah, if we kill\\r\\nhim now they may not believe us when we say that he slew Tarzan and we\\r\\ntook his life in punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if we keep him alive until we are met with the friends of Tarzan,\\r\\nshould it so befall that they overtake us, then we may say that we\\r\\ndid hold him prisoner that Tarzan\\'s own people might mete out their\\r\\nvengeance to him, which would suit them better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy words are not without wisdom,\" admitted Ibn Jad, \"but suppose\\r\\nthe Nasrany spoke lies concerning us and said that it was we who slew\\r\\nTarzan? Wouldst they not believe him above us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That be easily prevented,\" said the old man who had spoken before.\\r\\n\"Let us cut his tongue out forthwith that he may not bear false witness\\r\\nagainst us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, thou hast it!\" exclaimed Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, nay!\" cried Fahd. \"The better we treat him the larger will be\\r\\nthe reward that he will pay us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can wait until the last moment,\" said Ibn Jad, \"and we see that we\\r\\nare to lose him and our reward, then may we cut out his tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the fate of Wilbur Stimbol was left to the gods, and Ibn Jad,\\r\\ntemporarily freed from the menace of Tarzan, turned his attention once\\r\\nmore to his plans for entering the valley. With a strong party he went\\r\\nin person and sought a palaver with the Galla chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he approached the village of Batando he passed through the camps of\\r\\nthousands of Galla warriors and realized fully what he had previously\\r\\nsensed but vaguely--that his position was most precarious and that\\r\\nwith the best grace possible he must agree to whatever terms the old\\r\\nchief might propose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBatando received him graciously enough, though with all the majesty\\r\\nof a powerful monarch, and assured him that on the following day he\\r\\nwould escort him to the entrance to the valley, but that first he must\\r\\ndeliver to Batando all the Galla slaves that were with his party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that will leave us without carriers or servants and will greatly\\r\\nweaken the strength of my party,\" cried Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBatando but shrugged his black shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let them remain with us until we have returned from the valley,\"\\r\\nimplored the sheik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No Galla man may accompany you,\" said Batando with finality.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning the tent of Ibn Jad was struck in signal that\\r\\nall were to prepare for the rahla, and entirely surrounded by Galla\\r\\nwarriors they started toward the rugged mountains where lay the\\r\\nentrance to the valley of Ibn Jad\\'s dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nFejjuan and the other Galla slaves that the \\'Aarab had brought with\\r\\nthem from beled el-Guad marched with their own people, happy in their\\r\\nnew-found freedom. Stimbol, friendless, fearful, utterly cowed, trudged\\r\\nwearily along under guard of two young Beduins, his mind constantly\\r\\nreverting to the horror of the murdered man lying in his lonely grave\\r\\nbehind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinding steadily upward along what at times appeared to be an ancient\\r\\ntrail and again no trail at all, the \\'Aarab and their escort climbed\\r\\nhigher and higher into the rugged mountains that rim the Valley of the\\r\\nSepulcher upon the north. At the close of the second day, after they\\r\\nhad made camp beside a rocky mountain brook, Batando came to Ibn Jad\\r\\nand pointed to the entrance to a rocky side ravine that branched from\\r\\nthe main canyon directly opposite the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" he said, \"lies the trail into the valley. Here we leave you\\r\\nand return to our villages. Upon the morrow we go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun rose the following morning Ibn Jad discovered that the\\r\\nGallas had departed during the night, but he did not know it was\\r\\nbecause of the terror they felt for the mysterious inhabitants of the\\r\\nmysterious valley from which no Galla ever had returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day Ibn Jad spent in making a secure camp in which to leave the\\r\\nwomen and children until the warriors had returned from their adventure\\r\\nin the valley or had discovered that they might safely fetch their\\r\\nwomen, and the next morning, leaving a few old men and boys to protect\\r\\nthe camp, he set forth with those who were accounted the fighting men\\r\\namong them, and presently the watchers in the camp saw the last of them\\r\\ndisappear in the rocky ravine that lay opposite the menzil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _The Great Tourney_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Bohun with many knights and squires and serving men had ridden\\r\\ndown from his castle above the City of the Sepulcher two days ago to\\r\\nmake his way across the valley to the field before the city of Nimmr\\r\\nfor the Great Tourney that is held once each year, commencing upon the\\r\\nfirst Sunday in Lent.\\r\\n\\r\\nGay pennons fluttered from a thousand lance tips and gay with color\\r\\nwere the housings of the richly caparisoned chargers that proudly\\r\\nbore the Knights of the Sepulcher upon whose backs red crosses were\\r\\nemblazoned to denote that they had completed the pilgrimage to the Holy\\r\\nLand and were returning to home and England.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir bassinets, unlike those of the Knights of Nimmr, were covered\\r\\nwith bullock hide, and the devices upon their bucklers differed, and\\r\\ntheir colors. But for these and the crosses upon their backs they might\\r\\nhave been Gobred\\'s own good knights and true.\\r\\n\\r\\nSturdy sumpter beasts, almost as richly trapped as the knight\\'s steeds,\\r\\nbore the marquees and tilts that were to house the knights during the\\r\\ntourney, as well as their personal belongings, their extra arms and\\r\\ntheir provisions for the three days of the tourney; for custom, over\\r\\nseven centuries old, forbade the Knights of Nimmr and the Knights of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher breaking bread together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Tourney was merely a truce during which they carried on\\r\\ntheir ancient warfare under special rules which transformed it\\r\\ninto a gorgeous pageant and an exhibition of martial prowess which\\r\\nnoncombatants might witness in comfort and with impunity. It did not\\r\\npermit friendly intercourse between the two factions as this was not\\r\\ncompatible with the seriousness of the event, in which knights of both\\r\\nsides often were killed, or the spirit in which the grand prize was\\r\\nawarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis prize as much as any other factor had kept open the breach of\\r\\nseven and a half centuries\\' duration that separated the Fronters from\\r\\nthe Backers, for it consisted of five maidens whom the winners took\\r\\nback with them to their own city and who were never again seen by their\\r\\nfriends or relatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the sorrow was mitigated by the honorable treatment that custom\\r\\nand the laws of knighthood decreed should be accorded these unfortunate\\r\\nmaidens, it was still bitter because attached to it was the sting of\\r\\ndefeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the tournament the maidens became the especial charges of\\r\\nGobred or Bohun, dependent of course upon whether the honors of the\\r\\ntourney had fallen to the Fronters or the Backers, and in due course\\r\\nwere given in honorable marriage to knights of the victorious party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genesis of the custom, which was now fully seven centuries old,\\r\\ndoubtless lay in the wise desire of some ancient Gobred or Bohun to\\r\\nmaintain the stock of both factions strong and virile by the regular\\r\\ninfusion of new blood, as well, perhaps, as to prevent the inhabitants\\r\\nof the two cities from drifting too far apart in manners, customs and\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a happy wife of Nimmr had been born in the City of the Sepulcher\\r\\nand seldom was it that the girls themselves repined for long. It was\\r\\nconsidered an honor to be chosen and there were always many more who\\r\\nvolunteered than the requisite number of five that annually made the\\r\\nsacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five who constituted the prize offered by the City of the Sepulcher\\r\\nthis year rode on white palfreys and were attended by a guard of honor\\r\\nin silver mail. The girls, selected for their beauty to thus honor the\\r\\ncity of their birth, were gorgeously attired and weighed down with\\r\\nornaments of gold and silver and precious stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the plain before the city of Nimmr preparations for the tourney\\r\\nhad been in progress for many days. The lists were being dragged and\\r\\nrolled with heavy wooden rollers, the ancient stands of stone from\\r\\nwhich the spectators viewed the spectacle were undergoing their annual\\r\\nrepairs and cleansing, a frame superstructure was being raised to\\r\\nsupport the canopies that would shade the choice seats reserved for\\r\\nthe nobility, and staffs for a thousand pennons had been set around\\r\\nthe outer margin of the lists--these and a hundred other things were\\r\\noccupying a company of workmen; and in the walled city and in the\\r\\ncastle that stood above it the hammers of armorers and smiths rang far\\r\\ninto the night forging iron shoes and mail and lance tips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake had been assured that he was to have a part in the Great Tourney\\r\\nand was as keen for it as he had been for the big game of the season\\r\\nduring his football days at college. He had been entered in two sword\\r\\ncontests--one in which five Knights of Nimmr met five Knights of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher and another in which he was pitted against a single\\r\\nantagonist, but his only contest with the lance was to be in the grand\\r\\nfinale when a hundred Fronters faced a hundred Backers, since, whereas,\\r\\nbefore his encounter with Malud he had been considered hopeless with\\r\\nsword and buckler now Prince Gobred looked to him to win many points\\r\\nwith these, his lance work being held but mediocre.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Bohun and his followers were camped in a grove of oaks about a\\r\\nmile north of the lists, nor did the laws governing the Great Tourney\\r\\npermit them to come nearer until the hour appointed for their entrance\\r\\nupon the first day of the spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake, in preparing for the tourney, had followed the custom adopted\\r\\nby many of the knights of wearing distinctive armor and trapping his\\r\\ncharger similarly. His chain mail was all of solid black, relieved only\\r\\nby the leopard skin of his bassinet and the blue and silver pennon upon\\r\\nhis lance. The housings of his mount were of black, edged with silver\\r\\nand blue, and there were, of course, the prescribed red crosses upon\\r\\nhis breast and upon his horse housings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came from his quarters upon the opening morning of the tourney,\\r\\nfollowed by Edward bearing his lance and buckler, he appeared a somber\\r\\nfigure among the resplendently caparisoned knights and the gorgeously\\r\\ndressed women that were gathered in the great court awaiting the word\\r\\nto mount their horses which were being held in the north ballium by the\\r\\ngrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat his black mail was distinctive was evidenced by the attention he\\r\\nimmediately attracted, and that he had quickly become popular among the\\r\\nknights and ladies of Nimmr was equally apparent by the manner in which\\r\\nthey clustered about him, but opinion was divided in the matter of his\\r\\ncostume, some holding that it was too dismal and depressing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinalda was there but she remained seated upon a bench where she was\\r\\nconversing with one of the maidens that had been chosen as Nimmr\\'s\\r\\nprize. Blake quickly disengaged himself from those who had crowded\\r\\nabout him and crossed the court to where Guinalda sat. At his approach\\r\\nthe princess looked up and inclined her head slightly in recognition of\\r\\nhis bow and then she resumed her conversation with the maiden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rebuff was too obvious to permit of misunderstanding, but Blake was\\r\\nnot satisfied to accept it and go his way without an explanation. He\\r\\ncould scarce believe, however, that the princess was still vexed merely\\r\\nbecause he had intimated that he had believed that she took a greater\\r\\ninterest in him than she had admitted. There must be some other reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not turn and walk away, then, although she continued to ignore\\r\\nhim, but stood quietly before her waiting patiently until she should\\r\\nagain notice him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he noted that she was becoming nervous as was also the maiden\\r\\nwith whom she spoke. There were lapses in their conversation; one of\\r\\nGuinalda\\'s feet was tapping the flagging irritably; a slow flush was\\r\\ncreeping upward into her cheeks. The maiden fidgeted, she plucked at\\r\\nthe ends of the wimple that lay about her shoulders, she smoothed the\\r\\nrich cyclas of her mantle and finally she arose and bowing before the\\r\\nprincess asked if she might go and bid farewell to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinalda bade her begone and then, alone with Blake and no longer able\\r\\nto ignore him, nor caring to, she turned angrily upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was right!\" she snapped. \"Thou beest a forward boor. Why standeth\\r\\nthou thus staring at me when I have made it plain that I wouldst not be\\r\\nannoyed by thee? Go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because----\" Blake hesitated, \"because I love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sirrah!\" cried Guinalda, springing to her feet. \"How darest thou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would dare anything for you, my princess,\" replied Blake, \"because I\\r\\nlove you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinalda looked straight at him for a moment in silence, then her short\\r\\nupper lip curved in a contemptuous sneer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou liest!\" she said. \"I have heard what thou hast said concerning\\r\\nme!\" and without waiting for a reply she brushed past him and walked\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake hurried after her. \"What have I said about you?\" he demanded. \"I\\r\\nhave said nothing that I would not repeat before all Nimmr. Not even\\r\\nhave I presumed to tell my best friend, Sir Richard, that I love you.\\r\\nNot other ears than yours have heard that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard differently,\" said Guinalda, haughtily, \"and I care not\\r\\nto discuss the matter further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But----\" commenced Blake, but at that instant a trumpet sounded from\\r\\nthe north gate leading into the ballium. It was the signal for the\\r\\nknights to mount. Guinalda\\'s page came running to her to summon her to\\r\\nher father\\'s side. Sir Richard appeared and seized Blake by the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, James!\" he cried. \"We should have been mounted before now for we\\r\\nride in the forerank of the knights today.\" And so Blake was dragged\\r\\naway from the princess before he could obtain an explanation of her, to\\r\\nhim, inexplicable attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe north ballium presented a scene of color and activity, crowded as\\r\\nit was with knights and ladies, pages, squires, grooms, men-at-arms\\r\\nand horses, nor would it accommodate them all, so that the overflow\\r\\nstretched into the east and south balliums and even through the great\\r\\neast gate out upon the road that leads down into the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half an hour something very like chaos reigned about the castle of\\r\\nthe Prince of Nimmr, but eventually perspiring marshals and shouting\\r\\nheralds whipped the cortege into shape as it took its slow and imposing\\r\\nway down the winding mountain road toward the lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst rode the marshals and heralds and behind them a score of\\r\\ntrumpeters; then came Prince Gobred, riding alone, and following was a\\r\\ngreat company of knights, their colored pennons streaming in the wind.\\r\\nThey rode just before the ladies and behind the ladies was another\\r\\ncompany of knights, while in the rear marched company after company of\\r\\nmen-at-arms, some armed with cross bows, others with pikes and still\\r\\nothers again with battle-axes of huge proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps a hundred knights and men-at-arms all told were left behind to\\r\\nguard the castle and the entrance to the Valley of the Sepulcher, but\\r\\nthese would be relieved to witness the second and third days\\' exercises.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Knights of Nimmr wound down to the lists, the Knights of the\\r\\nSepulcher moved out from their camp among the oaks, and the marshals of\\r\\nthe two parties timed their approach so that both entered the lists at\\r\\nthe same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Nimmr dropped out of the procession and took their places\\r\\nin the stand; the five maidens of Nimmr and the five from the City of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher were escorted to a dais at one end of the lists, after\\r\\nwhich the knights lined up in solid ranks, the Knights of Nimmr upon\\r\\nthe south side of the lists, the Knights of the Sepulcher upon the\\r\\nnorth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGobred and Bohun rode forward and met in the center of the field,\\r\\nwhere, in measured and imposing tones, Bohun delivered the ancient\\r\\nchallenge prescribed by custom and the laws of the Great Tourney\\r\\nand handed Gobred the gage, the acceptance of which constituted an\\r\\nacceptance of the challenge and marked the official opening of the\\r\\ntourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Gobred and Bohun reined about and faced their own knights these rode\\r\\nout of the lists, those who were not to take part in the encounters of\\r\\nthe day seeking places in the stands after turning their chargers over\\r\\nto grooms, while those who were to participate formed again to ride\\r\\nonce around the lists, for the double purpose of indicating to their\\r\\nopponents and the spectators the entrants for that day and of viewing\\r\\nthe prizes offered by their opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the maidens there were many minor prizes consisting of\\r\\njeweled ornaments, suits of mail, lances, swords, bucklers, splendid\\r\\nsteeds and the many articles that were valued by knights or that might\\r\\nfind favor in the eyes of their ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knights of the Sepulcher paraded first, with Bohun at their head,\\r\\nand it was noticeable that the eyes of the king were often upon the\\r\\nwomen in the stands as he rode past. Bohun was a young man, having but\\r\\njust ascended the throne following the recent death of his father. He\\r\\nwas arrogant and tyrannical and it had been common knowledge in Nimmr\\r\\nthat for years he had been at the head of a faction that was strong for\\r\\nwar with Nimmr, that the city might be reduced and the entire Valley of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher brought under the rule of the Bohuns.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis charger prancing, his colors flying, his great company of knights\\r\\nat his back, King Bohun rode along the stands reserved for the people\\r\\nof Nimmr, and when he came to the central loge in which sat Prince\\r\\nGobred with the Princess Brynilda and Princess Guinalda, his eyes fell\\r\\nupon the face of the daughter of Gobred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohun reined in his charger and stared straight into the face of\\r\\nGuinalda. Gobred flushed angrily, for Bohun\\'s act was a breach of\\r\\ncourtesy, and half rose from his seat, but at that moment Bohun, bowing\\r\\nlow across his mount\\'s withers, moved on, followed by his knights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day the honors went to the Knights of the Sepulcher, for they\\r\\nscored two hundred and twenty-seven points against one hundred and six\\r\\nthat the Knights of Nimmr were able to procure.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the second day the tourney opened with the riding past of the\\r\\nentrants who, ordinarily, were conducted by a herald, but to the\\r\\nsurprise of all, Bohun again led his knights past the stands and again\\r\\nhe paused and looked full at the Princess Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day the Knights of Nimmr fared a little better, being for the day\\r\\nbut seven points behind their opponents, though the score for the two\\r\\ndays stood two hundred and sixty-nine to three hundred and ninety-seven\\r\\nin favor of the Knights of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the third day opened with the knights from the north boasting what\\r\\nseemed an insuperable lead of one hundred and twenty-eight points and\\r\\nthe Knights of Nimmr spurred to greater action by the knowledge that\\r\\nto win the tourney they must score two hundred and thirty-two of the\\r\\nremaining three hundred and thirty-four points.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, contrary to age old custom, Bohun led his entrants about\\r\\nthe lists as they paraded before the opening encounter, and once again\\r\\nhe drew rein before the loge of Gobred and his eyes rested upon the\\r\\nbeautiful face of Guinalda for an instant before he addressed her sire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prince Gobred of Nimmr,\" he said in his haughty and arrogant voice,\\r\\n\"as ye well know my valiant sir knights have bested thine by more than\\r\\nsix score points and the Great Tourney be as good as ours already. Yet\\r\\nwe would make thee a proposition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak Bohun! The Great Tourney is yet far from won, but an\\' ye have\\r\\nany proposition that an honorable prince may consider thou hast my\\r\\nassurance that \\'twill be given consideration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy five maidens are as good as ours,\" said Bohun, \"but give me thy\\r\\ndaughter to be queen of the Valley of the Sepulcher and I will grant\\r\\nthee the tourney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGobred went white with anger, but when he replied his voice was low and\\r\\neven for he was master of his own emotions, as befitted a princely man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Bohun,\" he said, refusing to accord to his enemy the title of\\r\\nking, \"thy words are an offense in the ears of honorable men, implying\\r\\nas they do that the daughter of a Gobred be for sale and that the honor\\r\\nof the knighthood of Nimmr may be bartered for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get thee hence to thine own side of the lists before I set serfs upon\\r\\nye to drive ye there with staves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that be thine answer, eh?\" shouted Bohun. \"Then know ye that I\\r\\nshall take the five maidens by the rules of the Great Tourney and thy\\r\\ndaughter by force of arms!\" With this threat delivered he wheeled his\\r\\nsteed and spurred away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord of Bohun\\'s proposition and his rebuff spread like wild fire\\r\\nthroughout the ranks of the Knights of Nimmr so that those who were to\\r\\ncontend this last day of the tourney were keyed to the highest pitch of\\r\\nderring do in the defence of the honor of Nimmr and the protection of\\r\\nthe Princess Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great lead attained by the Knights of the Sepulcher during the\\r\\nfirst two days was but an added incentive to greater effort, provoking\\r\\nthem, as a spur, to the utmost limits of daring and exertion. There was\\r\\nno need that their marshals should exhort them. The youth and chivalry\\r\\nof Nimmr had heard the challenge and would answer it in the lists!\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake\\'s sword and buckler encounter with a Knight of the Sepulcher was\\r\\nscheduled for the first event of the day. When the lists were cleared\\r\\nhe rode in to a fanfare of trumpets, moving parallel with the south\\r\\nstands while his adversary rode along the front of the north stands,\\r\\nthe latter halting before the loge of Bohun as Blake drew rein in front\\r\\nof that of Gobred, where he raised the hilt of his sword to his lips\\r\\nto the Prince, though his eyes were upon Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Conduct thyself as a true knight this day to the glory and honor of\\r\\nNimmr,\" charged Gobred, \"and may the blessings of Our Lord Jesus be\\r\\nupon thee and thy sword, our well beloved Sir James!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the glory and honor of Nimmr I pledge my sword and my life!\" should\\r\\nhave been Blake\\'s reply according to the usages of the Great Tourney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the glory and honor of Nimmr and to the protection of my Princess I\\r\\npledge my sword and my life!\" is what he said, and it was evident from\\r\\nthe expression on Gobred\\'s face that he was not displeased, while the\\r\\nlook of haughty disdain which had been upon Guinalda\\'s face softened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly she arose and tearing a ribbon from her gown stepped to the\\r\\nfront of the loge. \"Receive this favor from thy lady, sir knight,\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"bearing it with honor and to victory in thy encounter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake reined closed to the rail of the loge and bent low while Guinalda\\r\\npinned the ribbon upon his shoulder. His face was close to hers; he\\r\\nsensed the intoxicating perfume of her hair; he felt her warm breath\\r\\nupon his cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love you,\" he whispered, so low that no other ears than hers could\\r\\nhear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art a boor,\" she replied in a voice as low as his. \"It be for the\\r\\nsake of the five maidens that I encourage ye with this favor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake looked straight into her eyes. \"I love you, Guinalda,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and--you love me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she could reply he had wheeled away, the trumpets had sounded,\\r\\nand he was cantering slowly toward the end of the field where the tilts\\r\\nof the Knights of Nimmr stood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward, very much excited, was there and Sir Richard and Michel, with\\r\\na marshal, heralds, trumpeters, men-at-arms--a martial company to urge\\r\\nhim on with encouragement and advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake cast aside his buckler, nor was there any to reprove him now.\\r\\nInstead they smiled proudly and knowingly, for had they not seen him\\r\\nbest Sir Malud without other defense than his horsemanship and his\\r\\nsword?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trumpets blared again. Blake turned and put spurs to his charger.\\r\\nStraight down the center of the lists he rode. From the opposite end\\r\\ncame a Knight of the Sepulcher to meet him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir James! Sir James!\" cried the spectators in the stands upon the\\r\\nsouth side, while the north stands answered with the name of their\\r\\nchampion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is the black knight?\" asked many a man in the north stands of his\\r\\nneighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hath no buckler!\" cried some. \"He be mad!\" \"Sir Guy wilt cleave him\\r\\nopen at the first pass!\" \"Sir Guy! Sir Guy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n                           \"_The Saracens!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the second day of the Great Tourney had opened in the Valley of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher upon the plains below the city of Nimmr, a band of swart\\r\\nmen in soiled thobs and carrying long matchlocks topped the summit of\\r\\nthe pass upon the north side of the valley and looked down upon the\\r\\nCity of the Sepulcher and the castle of King Bohun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had followed upward along what may once have been a trail, but\\r\\nfor so long a time had it been unused, or so infrequently had it been\\r\\nused that it was scarce distinguishable from the surrounding brush; but\\r\\nbelow them now Ibn Jad saw at a short distance a better marked road\\r\\nand, beyond, what appeared to him a fortress. Beyond that again he\\r\\nglimpsed the battlements of Bohun\\'s castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat he saw in the foreground was the barbican guarding the approach to\\r\\nthe castle and the city, both of which were situated in much the same\\r\\nrelative position as were the barbican and castle upon the south side\\r\\nof the valley where Prince Gobred guarded the city of Nimmr and the\\r\\nvalley beyond it against the daily expected assault of the Saracens.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeking cover, Ibn Jad and his Beduins crept down toward the barbican\\r\\nwhere an old knight and a few men-at-arms kept perfunctory ward. Hiding\\r\\nin the mountain brush the \\'Aarab saw two strangely apparelled blacks\\r\\nhunting just outside the great gateway. They were armed with cross\\r\\nbows and arrows and their prey was rabbits. For years they had seen no\\r\\nstranger come down this ancient road, and for years they had hunted\\r\\nbetween the gate and the summit of the mountains, though farther than\\r\\nthis they were not permitted to wander. Nor had they any great desire\\r\\nto do so, for, though they were descendants of Gallas who lived just\\r\\nbeyond this mountain top, they thought that they were Englishmen and\\r\\nthat a horde of Saracens awaited to annihilate them should they venture\\r\\ntoo far afield.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday they hunted as they had often hunted when they chanced to be\\r\\nplaced in the guard at the outer barbican. They moved silently forward,\\r\\nwarily awaiting the break of a rabbit. They did not see the dark-faced\\r\\nmen in the brush.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad saw that the great gateway was open and that the gate that\\r\\nclosed it raised and lowered vertically. It was raised now. Great was\\r\\nthe laxity of the old knight and the men-at-arms, but King Bohun was\\r\\naway and there was none to reprove them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad motioned those nearest him to follow and crept slowly closer to\\r\\nthe gateway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of the old knight and the other watchers? The former was partaking\\r\\nof a late breakfast just within one of the great towers of the barbican\\r\\nand the latter were taking advantage of the laxity of his discipline to\\r\\ncatch a few more winks of sleep as they stretched beneath the shade of\\r\\nsome trees within the ballium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad won to within a few yards of the gateway and waited for the\\r\\nothers to reach his side. When they were all there he whispered to them\\r\\nand then trotted on silent sandals toward the gate, his matchlock ready\\r\\nin his hands. Behind him came his fellows. They were all within the\\r\\nballium before the men-at-arms were aware that there was an enemy this\\r\\nside of Palestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith cross-bow and battle-axe the men-at-arms sprang to defend the\\r\\ngate. Their cries of \"The Saracens! The Saracens!\" brought the old sir\\r\\nknight and the hunters running toward the ballium.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow, at the castle of King Bohun, the men at the gates and the other\\r\\nretainers who had been left while Bohun sallied forth to the Great\\r\\nTourney heard strange noises from the direction of the outer barbican.\\r\\nThe shouts of men floated down to them and strange, sharp sounds that\\r\\nwere like thunder and yet unlike it. Such sounds they had never heard\\r\\nbefore, nor any of their forbears. They rallied at the outer castle\\r\\ngate and the knights with them consulted as to what was best to be\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing brave knights there seemed but one thing open for them. If those\\r\\nat the far outer barbican had been attacked they must hasten to their\\r\\ndefense. Summoning all but four of the knights and men-at-arms at his\\r\\ndisposal the marshal of the castle mounted and rode forth toward the\\r\\nouter gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf way there they were espied by Ibn Jad and his men who, having\\r\\novercome the poorly armed soldiers at the gate, were advancing down\\r\\nthe road toward the castle. At sight of these reinforcements Ibn Jad\\r\\nhastened to secrete his followers and himself in the bushes that lined\\r\\nthe roadway. So it fell that the marshal rode by them and did not see\\r\\nthem and, when they had passed, Ibn Jad and his followers came out of\\r\\nthe bushes and continued down the winding mountain road toward the\\r\\ncastle of King Bohun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men at the castle gate, now fully upon the alert, stood ready with\\r\\nthe portcullis raised as the marshal instructed them, so that in the\\r\\nevent that those who had ridden out should be hard pressed upon their\\r\\nreturn by an enemy at their rear they could still find sanctuary within\\r\\nthe ballium. The plan was, in such event, to lower the portcullis\\r\\nbehind the men of the Sepulcher and in the faces of the pursuing\\r\\nSaracens, for that an enemy must be such was a forgone conclusion--had\\r\\nnot they and their ancestors waited for near seven and a half\\r\\ncenturies now for this momentarily expected assault? They wondered if\\r\\nit really had come at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they discussed the question Ibn Jad watched them from a\\r\\nconcealing clump of bushes a few yards away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wily Beduin knew the purpose of that portcullis and he was trying\\r\\nto plan best how he might enter the enclosure beyond before it could\\r\\nbe dropped before his face. At last he found a plan and smiled. He\\r\\nbeckoned three men to come close and into their ears he whispered that\\r\\nwhich he had in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were four men-at-arms ready to drop the portcullis at the\\r\\npsychological moment and all four of them stood in plain sight of\\r\\nIbn Jad and the three that were beside him. Carefully, cautiously,\\r\\nnoiselessly the four \\'Aarab raised their ancient matchlocks and took\\r\\ncareful aim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now!\" whispered Ibn Jad and four matchlocks belched forth flame and\\r\\nblack powder and slugs of lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four men-at-arms dropped to the stone flagging and Ibn Jad and all\\r\\nhis followers raced forward and stood within the ballium of the castle\\r\\nof King Bohun. Before them, across the ballium, was another gate and a\\r\\nbroad moat, but the drawbridge was lowered, the portcullis raised and\\r\\nthe gateway unguarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marshal and his followers had ridden unhindered into the ballium of\\r\\nthe outer barbican and there they had found all its defenders lying in\\r\\ntheir own blood, even to the little squire of the old knight who should\\r\\nhave watched the gate and did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the men-at-arms still lived and in his dying breath he gasped\\r\\nthe terrible truth. The Saracens had come at last!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are they?\" demanded the marshal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didst thou not see them, sir?\" asked the dying man. \"They marched down\\r\\nthe road toward the castle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" cried the marshal. \"We didst but ride along that very\\r\\nroad and saw no one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They marched down toward the castle,\" gasped the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marshal knit his brows. \"Were there many?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are few,\" replied the man-at-arms. \"It was but the advance guard\\r\\nof the armies of the sultan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then the volley that laid low the four warders at the castle gate\\r\\ncrashed upon the ears of the marshal and his men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ods blud!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They must have hid themselves in the bush as we passed,\" exclaimed a\\r\\nknight at the marshal\\'s side, \"for of a surety they be there and we be\\r\\nhere and there be but one road between.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There be but four men at the castle gate,\" said the marshal, \"and I\\r\\ndid bid them keep the \\'cullis up til we returned. God pity me! I have\\r\\ngiven over the Sepulcher to the Saracens. Slay me, Sir Morley!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, man! We need every lance and sword and cross-bow that we may\\r\\ncommand. This be no time to think of taking thy life when thou canst\\r\\ngive it to Our Lord Jesus in defense of His Sepulcher against the\\r\\ninfidels!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art right, Morley,\" cried the marshal. \"Remain you here, then,\\r\\nwith six men and hold this gate. I shall return with the others and\\r\\ngive battle at the castle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the marshal came again to the castle gate he found the\\r\\nportcullis down and a dark-faced, bearded Saracen glaring at him\\r\\nthrough the iron bars. The marshal at once ordered the cross-bowmen\\r\\nto shoot the fellow down, but as they raised their weapons to their\\r\\nshoulder there was a loud explosion that almost deafened them and flame\\r\\nleaped from a strange thing that the Saracen held against his shoulder\\r\\nand pointed at them. One of the cross-bowmen screamed and lunged\\r\\nforward upon his face and the others turned and fled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were brave men in the face of dangers that were natural and to\\r\\nbe expected, but in the presence of the supernatural, the weird, the\\r\\nuncanny, they reacted as most men do, and what could have been more\\r\\nweird than death leaping in flame and with a great noise through space\\r\\nto strike their fellow down?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sir Bulland, the marshal, was a knight of the Sepulcher. He might\\r\\nwish to run away fully as much as the simple and lowly men-at-arms, but\\r\\nthere was something that held him there that was more potent than fear\\r\\nof death. It is called Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Bulland could not run away and so he sat there on his great horse\\r\\nand challenged the Saracens to mortal combat; challenged them to send\\r\\ntheir doughtiest sir knight to meet him and thus decide who should hold\\r\\nthe gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the \\'Aarab already held it. Furthermore they did not understand\\r\\nhim. In addition to all this they were without honor as Sir Bulland\\r\\nknew it, and perhaps as any one other than a Beduin knows it, and would\\r\\nbut have laughed at his silly suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing they did know--two things they knew--that he was a Nasrany\\r\\nand that he was unarmed. They did not count his great lance and his\\r\\nsword as weapons, for he could not reach them with either. So one of\\r\\nthem took careful aim and shot Sir Bulland through his chain mail where\\r\\nit covered his noble and chivalrous heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad had the run of the castle of King Bohun and he was sure that\\r\\nhe had discovered the fabled City of Nimmr that the sahar had told him\\r\\nof. He herded together the women and children and the few men that\\r\\nremained and held them under guard. For a while he was minded to slay\\r\\nthem, since they were but Nasrany, but he was so pleased at having\\r\\nfound and taken the treasure city that he let them live--for the time\\r\\nat least.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his command his followers ransacked the castle in search of the\\r\\ntreasure. Nor were they disappointed, for the riches of Bohun were\\r\\ngreat. There was gold in the hills of the Valley of the Sepulcher and\\r\\nthere were precious stones to be found there, also. For seven and\\r\\na half centuries the slaves of the Sepulcher and of Nimmr had been\\r\\nwashing gold from the creek beds and salvaging precious stones from the\\r\\nsame source. The real value of such was not to the men of the Sepulcher\\r\\nand Nimmr what it would be to men of the outer world. They but esteemed\\r\\nthese things as trinkets, yet they liked them and saved them and even\\r\\nbartered for them on occasion, but they did not place them in vaults\\r\\nunder lock and key. Why should they in a land where such things were\\r\\nnot stolen? Their women and their horses they guarded, but not their\\r\\ngold or their jewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Ibn Jad gathered a great sack full of treasure, enough to\\r\\nsatisfy his wildest imaginings of cupidity. He gathered all that he\\r\\ncould find in the castle of King Bohun, more than he had hoped to find\\r\\nin this fabled city; and then a strange thing happened. Having more\\r\\nwealth than he possibly could use he wanted more. No, not so strange\\r\\nafter all, for Ibn Jad was human.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spent the night with his followers in the castle of King Bohun and\\r\\nduring the night he planned, for he had seen a wide valley stretching\\r\\nfar away to other mountains and at the base of those mountains he had\\r\\nseen that which appeared to be a city. \"Perhaps,\" thought Ibn Jad, \"it\\r\\nis a richer city than this. I shall start on the morrow to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _The Black Knight_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the field thundered the two chargers. Silence fell upon the\\r\\nstands. They were almost met when Sir Guy realized that his adversary\\r\\nbore no shield. But what of that? He had been sent into the lists by\\r\\nhis own people--the responsibility was theirs, the advantage Sir Guy\\'s.\\r\\nHad they sent him in without a sword Sir Guy might still have slain him\\r\\nwithout besmirching his knightly honor, for such were the laws of the\\r\\nGreat Tourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet his discovery had its effect upon the Knight of the Sepulcher as\\r\\njust for an instant it had distracted his attention from the thought\\r\\nthat should have been uppermost in his mind--gaining the primary\\r\\nadvantage by the skill of his opening attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw his antagonist\\'s horse swing out just before they met. He stood\\r\\nin his stirrups, as had Sir Malud, to deliver a terrific cut; then\\r\\nBlake threw his horse straight into the shoulder of Sir Guy\\'s. The\\r\\nlatter\\'s sword fell and with a loud, clanging noise slipped harmlessly\\r\\nfrom the blade of the Knight of Nimmr. Guy had raised his buckler to\\r\\nprotect his own head and neck and could not see Sir James. Guy\\'s horse\\r\\nstumbled and nearly fell. As it recovered itself Blake\\'s blade slipped\\r\\nbeneath the buckler of the Knight of the Sepulcher and its point\\r\\npierced the gorget of his adversary and passed through his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a cry that ended in a blood choked gurgle Sir Guy of the Sepulcher\\r\\ntoppled backward upon his horse\\'s rump and rolled upon the ground while\\r\\nthe south stands went mad with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laws of the Great Tourney account the knight who is unhorsed as\\r\\nslain, so the coup-de-grace is never given and no knight is killed\\r\\nunnecessarily. The victor rides to the tilt of the vanquished, wheels\\r\\nabout and gallops to his own tilt, the full length of the lists, where\\r\\nhe waits until a herald of the opposing side fetches the prize to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was that as Blake swung from his saddle, sword in hand, and\\r\\napproached the fallen Sir Guy, a gasp arose from the south stands and a\\r\\nroar of angry protest from the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshals and heralds galloped madly from the tilt of the fallen Backer\\r\\nand, seeing this, Sir Richard, fearing that Blake would be set upon and\\r\\nslain, led a similar party from his end of the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake approached the fallen knight, who lay upon his back, feebly\\r\\nstruggling to arise, and when the spectators looked to see him run Sir\\r\\nGuy through with his sword they saw him instead toss the weapon to the\\r\\nground and kneel beside the wounded man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an arm beneath Sir Guy\\'s shoulders he raised him and held him\\r\\nagainst his knee while he tore off his helm and gorget, and when the\\r\\nmarshals and the heralds and the others drew rein beside him Blake was\\r\\ntrying to staunch the flow of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quick!\" he cried to them, \"a chirurgeon! His jugular is not touched,\\r\\nbut this flow of blood must be stopped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the knights dismounted and gathered about, and among them\\r\\nwas Sir Richard. A herald of Sir Guy\\'s faction kneeled and took the\\r\\nyouth from Blake\\'s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come!\" said Richard. \"Leave the sir knight to his own friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake arose. He saw how peculiar were the expressions upon the faces of\\r\\nthe knights about him, but as he drew away one of them spoke. An older\\r\\nman, who was one of Bohun\\'s marshals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art a generous and chivalrous knight,\" he said to Blake, \"and a\\r\\ncourageous one too who would thus set at naught the laws of the Great\\r\\nTourney and the customs of centuries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake faced him squarely. \"I do not give a damn for your laws or\\r\\nyour customs,\" he said. \"Where I come from a decent man wouldn\\'t let\\r\\na yellow dog bleed to death without trying to save him, much less a\\r\\nbrave and gallant boy like this, and because he fell by my hand, by the\\r\\ncustoms of my country I should be compelled to aid him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" explained Sir Richard, \"as otherwise he would be punished with a\\r\\nraspberry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winning of the first event of the day was but a forerunner of a\\r\\nseries of successes on the part of the Knights of Nimmr until, at the\\r\\nopening of the last event, the score showed four hundred fifty-two\\r\\npoints for them against four hundred forty-eight for their opponents.\\r\\nA margin of four points, however, was as nothing at this stage of the\\r\\ntourney, as the final event held one hundred points which Fate might\\r\\nallot almost entirely to one side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the most spectacular event of the whole tourney and one which\\r\\nthe spectators always looked forward to with the greatest anticipation.\\r\\nTwo hundred knights were engaged in it, one hundred Knights of Nimmr\\r\\nagainst one hundred Knights of the Sepulcher. They formed at opposite\\r\\nends of the lists and as the trumpets sounded the signal they charged\\r\\nwith lances, and thus they fought until all of one side had been\\r\\nunhorsed or had retired from the field because of wounds. Broken\\r\\nlances could be replaced as a polo player may ride out and obtain a\\r\\nfresh mallet when he breaks his. Otherwise there were few rules to\\r\\ngovern this concluding number of the Great Tourney, which more nearly\\r\\napproximated a battle scene than any other event of the three days of\\r\\nconflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake had won his fifteen points for the Knights of Nimmr in the\\r\\nopening event of the day and again with four other comrades, pitted\\r\\nagainst five mounted swordsmen from the north, he had helped to add\\r\\nstill further points to the growing score of the Fronters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was entered in the last event largely because the marshals\\r\\nappreciated the value of his horsemanship and felt that it would more\\r\\nthan compensate for his inexperience with the lance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two hundred mailed knights had paraded for the final event and were\\r\\nforming line at opposite ends of the lists, one hundred Knights of the\\r\\nSepulcher at one end and one hundred Knights of Nimmr at the other.\\r\\nTheir chargers, especially selected for this encounter, were powerful\\r\\nand fleet, chosen for their courage as were the youths who bestrode\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knights, with few exceptions, were youths in their twenties, for to\\r\\nyouth went the laurels of this great sport of the Middle Ages as they\\r\\nstill do in the sports of today. Here and there was a man of middle\\r\\nage, a hardened veteran whose heart and hand had withstood the march of\\r\\nyears and whose presence exerted a steadying influence upon the young\\r\\nknights the while it spurred them to their utmost efforts, for these\\r\\nwere champions whose deeds were sung by minstrels in the great halls of\\r\\nthe castles of Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn proud array, with upright lances and fluttering pennons, the\\r\\nsunlight glinting from burnished mail and bit and boss and shining\\r\\nbrightly upon the gorgeous housings of their mounts, the two hundred\\r\\npresented a proud and noble spectacle as they awaited the final summons\\r\\nof the trumpet.\\r\\n\\r\\nRearing and plunging, eager to be off, many a war horse broke the line\\r\\nas will a thoroughbred at the barrier, while at one side and opposite\\r\\nthe center of the lists a herald waited for the moment that both lines\\r\\nshould be formed before he gave the signal that would send these iron\\r\\nmen hurtling into combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake found himself well toward the center of the line of Nimmr\\'s\\r\\nknights, beneath him a great black that fretted to be off, before him\\r\\nthe flower of the knighthood of the Sepulcher. In his right hand he\\r\\ngrasped a heavy, iron-shod lance, the butt of which rested in a boot\\r\\nat his stirrup, and upon his left arm he bore a great shield, nor had\\r\\nhe any wish to discard it in the face of all those sturdy, iron-tipped\\r\\nlances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he looked down the long length of the lists upon the hundred knights\\r\\nthat would presently be racing toward him in solid array with lance\\r\\npoints projecting far ahead of their horses, Blake felt that his shield\\r\\nwas entirely inadequate and he experienced a certain nervousness that\\r\\nreminded him of similar moments of tense waiting for the referee\\'s\\r\\nwhistle during his football days--those seemingly long gone days of\\r\\nanother life that he sensed now as a remote and different incarnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last came the signal! He saw the herald raise his sword on high.\\r\\nWith the two hundred he gathered his restive charger and couched his\\r\\nlance. The sword fell! From the four corners of the lists trumpets\\r\\nblared; from two hundred throats rose the cri de guerre; four hundred\\r\\nspurs transmitted the awaited signal from man to horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thundering lines bore down the field while a score of heralds\\r\\nraced along the flanks and rear to catch any infraction of the sole\\r\\nregulation that bore upon the final tumultuous collision. Each knight\\r\\nmust engage the foe upon his bridle hand, for to couch his lance upon\\r\\nthe one to his right was an unknightly act, since thus a single knight\\r\\nmight have two lances set upon him at once, against which there could\\r\\nbe no defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom above the rim of his shield Blake saw the solid front of lances,\\r\\niron-shod chargers and great shields almost upon him. The speed, the\\r\\nweight, the momentum seemed irresistible and, metaphorically, with deep\\r\\nrespect Blake took his hat off to the knights of old.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the two lines were about to meet! The spectators sat in spellbound\\r\\nsilence; the riders, grim-jawed, with tight set lips, were voiceless\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake, his lance across his horse\\'s withers, picked the knight racing\\r\\ntoward him upon his left hand; for an instant he caught the other\\'s\\r\\neyes and then each crouched behind his shield as the two lines came\\r\\ntogether with a deafening crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake\\'s shield smashed back against his face and body with such\\r\\nterrific force that he was almost carried from his saddle. He felt his\\r\\nown lance strike and splinter and then, half stunned, he was through\\r\\nthe iron line, his charger, frantic and uncontrolled, running wildly\\r\\ntoward the tilts of Bohun\\'s knights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an effort Blake pulled himself together, gathered his reins and\\r\\nfinally managed to get his horse under control, and it was not until he\\r\\nhad reined him about that he got his first glimpse of the result of the\\r\\nopening encounter. A half dozen chargers were scrambling to their feet\\r\\nand nearly a score more were galloping, riderless, about the lists. A\\r\\nfull twenty-five knights lay upon the field and twice that many squires\\r\\nand serving men were running in on foot to succor their masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready several of the knights had again set their lances against\\r\\nan enemy and Blake saw one of the Knights of the Sepulcher bearing\\r\\ndown upon him, but he raised his broken spear shaft above his head to\\r\\nindicate that he was momentarily hors de combat and galloped swiftly\\r\\nback to his own end of the lists where Edward was awaiting him with a\\r\\nfresh weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou didst nobly well, beloved master,\" cried Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did I get my man?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That thou didst, sir,\" Edward assured him, beaming with pride and\\r\\npleasure, \"and al be thou breakest thy lance upon his shield thou\\r\\ndidst e\\'en so unhorse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArmed anew Blake turned back toward the center of the lists where many\\r\\nindividual encounters were taking place. Already several more knights\\r\\nwere down and the victors looking for new conquests in which the stands\\r\\nwere assisting with hoarse cries and advice, and as Blake rode back\\r\\ninto the lists he was espied by many in the north stands occupied by\\r\\nthe knights and followers of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The black knight!\" they cried. \"Here! Here! Sir Wildred! Here is the\\r\\nblack knight that overthrew Sir Guy. Have at him, Sir Wildred!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Wildred, a hundred yards away, couched his lance. \"Have at thee,\\r\\nSir Black Knight!\" he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re on!\" Blake shouted back, putting spurs to the great black.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Wildred was a large man and he bestrode a raw-boned roan with the\\r\\nspeed of a deer and the heart of a lion. The pair would have been a\\r\\nmatch for the best of Nimmr\\'s knighthood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was as well for Blake\\'s peace of mind that Wildred appeared\\r\\nto him like any other knight and that he did not know that he was the\\r\\nmost sung of all the heroes of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, any knight looked formidable to Blake, who was\\r\\nstill at a loss to understand how he had unhorsed his man in the first\\r\\nencounter of this event.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bird must have lost both stirrups,\" is what he had mentally\\r\\nassured himself when Edward had announced his victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he couched his lance like a good sir knight and true and bore down\\r\\nupon the redoubtable Sir Wildred. The Knight of the Sepulcher was\\r\\ncharging diagonally across the field from the south stands. Beyond\\r\\nhim Blake caught a glimpse of a slim, girlish figure standing in the\\r\\ncentral loge. He could not see her eyes, but he knew that they were\\r\\nupon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my Princess!\" he whispered as Sir Wildred loomed large before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLance smote on shield as the two knights crashed together with terrific\\r\\nforce and Blake felt himself lifted clear of his saddle and hurled\\r\\nheavily to the ground. He was neither stunned nor badly hurt and as\\r\\nhe sat up a sudden grin wreathed his face, for there, scarce a lance\\r\\nlength from him, sat Sir Wildred. But Sir Wildred did not smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Sdeath!\" he cried. \"Thou laughest at me, sirrah?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I look as funny as you do,\" Blake assured him, \"you\\'ve got a laugh\\r\\ncoming too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Wildred knit his brows. \"Ods blud!\" he exclaimed. \"An thou beest a\\r\\nknight of Nimmr I be a Saracen! Who beest thou? Thy speech savoreth not\\r\\nof the Valley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake had arisen. \"Hurt much?\" he asked stepping forward. \"Here, I\\'ll\\r\\ngive you a hand up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art, of a certainty, a strange sir knight,\" said Wildred. \"I\\r\\nrecall now that thou didst offer succor to Sir Guy when thou hadst\\r\\nfairly vanquished him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s wrong with that?\" asked Blake. \"I haven\\'t anything\\r\\nagainst you. We\\'ve had a bully good scrap and are out of it. Why should\\r\\nwe sit here and make faces at one another?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Wildred shook his head. \"Thou are beyond my comprehension,\" he\\r\\nadmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time their squires and a couple of serving men had arrived, but\\r\\nneither of the fallen knights was so badly injured that he could not\\r\\nwalk without assistance. As they started for their respective tilts\\r\\nBlake turned and smiled at Wildred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So long, old man!\" he cried cheerily. \"Hope we meet again some day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill shaking his head Sir Wildred limped away, followed by the two who\\r\\nhad come to assist him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his tilt Blake learned that the outcome of the Great Tourney still\\r\\nhung in the balance and it was another half hour before the last of\\r\\nthe Knights of Nimmr went down in defeat, leaving two Knights of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher victorious upon the field. But this was not enough to\\r\\novercome the lead of four points that the Fronters had held at the\\r\\nopening of the last event and a moment later the heralds announced\\r\\nthat the Knights of Nimmr had won the Great Tourney by the close margin\\r\\nof two points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmidst the shouting of the occupants of the stands at the south the\\r\\nKnights of Nimmr who had taken part in the tourney and had won points\\r\\nfor the Fronters formed to ride upon the lists and claim the grand\\r\\nprize. Not all were there, as some had been killed or wounded in\\r\\nencounters that had followed their victories, though the toll on both\\r\\nsides had been much smaller than Blake had imagined that it would be.\\r\\nFive men were dead and perhaps twenty too badly injured to ride, the\\r\\ncasualties being about equally divided.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Knights of Nimmr rode down the field to claim the five maidens\\r\\nfrom the City of the Sepulcher, Bohun gathered all his knights at his\\r\\nside of the lists as though preparing to ride back to his camp. At the\\r\\nsame time a Knight of the Sepulcher, wearing the leopard skin bassinet\\r\\nof Nimmr, entered the stands upon the south side of the field and made\\r\\nhis way toward the loge of Prince Gobred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohun watched. The Knights of Nimmr were at the far end of the field\\r\\nengrossed in the ritualistic rites that the laws of the Great Tourney\\r\\nprescribed for the reception of the five maidens.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose beside Bohun two young knights sat their chargers, their eyes\\r\\nupon their king, and one of them held the bridle of a riderless horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Bohun raised his hand and spurred across the field followed by\\r\\nhis knights. They moved a little toward the end of the field where the\\r\\nKnights of Nimmr were congregated so that the bulk of them were between\\r\\nthis end of the field and Gobred\\'s loge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young knight who had sat close beside Bohun, and his companion\\r\\nleading the riderless horse, spurred at a run straight for the stands\\r\\nof Nimmr and the loge of the Prince. As they drew in abreast of it a\\r\\nknight leaped into the loge from the rear, swept Guinalda into his\\r\\narms, tossed her quickly to the young knight waiting to receive her,\\r\\nsprang to the edge of the rail and leaped into the saddle of the spare\\r\\nhorse being held in readiness for him; then they both wheeled and\\r\\nspurred away before the surprised Gobred or those about him could raise\\r\\na hand to stay them. Behind them swept Bohun and the Knights of the\\r\\nSepulcher, out toward the camp among the oaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly all was pandemonium. A trumpeter in Gobred\\'s loge sounded\\r\\nthe alarm; the prince ran from the stands to the spot where his horse\\r\\nwas being held by a groom; the Knights of Nimmr, ignorant of what had\\r\\noccurred, not knowing where to rally or against whom, milled about the\\r\\nlists for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Gobred came, spurring swiftly before them. \"Bohun has stolen the\\r\\nPrincess Guinalda!\" he cried. \"Knights of Nimmr--\" but before he could\\r\\nsay more, or issue orders to his followers, a black knight on a black\\r\\ncharger spurred roughly through the ranks of surrounding men and was\\r\\naway after the retreating Knights of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n                             _Lord Tarzan_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a nasty smile upon Tollog\\'s lips as he thought how neatly\\r\\nhe had foiled Ateja, who would have warned the Nasrany of the plot to\\r\\nslay him, and he thanked Allah that chance had placed him in a position\\r\\nto intercept her before she had been able to ruin them all. Even as\\r\\nTollog, the brother of the sheik, smiled in his beard a hand reached\\r\\nout of the darkness behind him and seized him by the throat--fingers\\r\\ngrasped him and he was dragged away.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the beyt that had been Zeyd\\'s and which had been set up for the\\r\\nNasrany, Tollog was dragged. He struggled and tried to scream for help,\\r\\nbut he was powerless in the grip of steel that held him and choked him.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the beyt a voice whispered in his ear. \"Cry out, Tollog,\" it\\r\\nsaid, \"and I shall have to kill you.\" Then the grasp upon his throat\\r\\nrelaxed, but Tollog did not call for help, for he had recognized the\\r\\nvoice that spoke and he knew that it had made no idle threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lay still while the bonds were drawn tight about his wrists and\\r\\nankles and a gag fastened securely in his mouth. He felt the folds of\\r\\nhis burnous drawn across his face and then--silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard Stimbol creep into the beyt, but he thought that it was still\\r\\nhe who had bound him. And thus died Tollog, the brother of Ibn Jad,\\r\\ndied as he had planned that Tarzan of the Apes should die.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, knowing that he would die thus, there was a smile upon the lips of\\r\\nthe ape-man as he swung through the forest toward the southeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan\\'s quest was not for Beduins but for Blake. Having assured\\r\\nhimself that the white man in the menzil of Ibn Jad was Stimbol and\\r\\nthat none knew the whereabouts of the other American, he was hastening\\r\\nback to the locality where Blake\\'s boys had told him their bwana had\\r\\ndisappeared, in the hope of picking up his trail and, if unable to\\r\\nassist him, at least to learn what fate had overtaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan moved swiftly and his uncanny senses of sight and smell aided\\r\\nhim greatly in wresting its secrets from the jungle, yet it was three\\r\\ndays before he found the spot where Ara the lightning had struck down\\r\\nBlake\\'s gun bearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he discovered Blake\\'s faint spoor leading toward the north. Tarzan\\r\\nshook his head, for he knew that there was a stretch of uninhabited\\r\\nforest laying between this place and the first Galla villages. Also he\\r\\nknew that if Blake survived hunger and the menace of wild beasts he\\r\\nmight only live to fall victim to a Galla spear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days Tarzan followed a spoor that no other human eye might have\\r\\ndiscerned. On the afternoon of the second day he came upon a great\\r\\nstone cross built directly in the center of an ancient trail. Tarzan\\r\\nsaw the cross from the concealment of bushes for he moved as beasts\\r\\nof prey moved, taking advantage of every cover, suspicious of every\\r\\nstrange object, always ready for flight or battle as occasion might\\r\\ndemand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was that he did not walk blindly into the clutches of the two\\r\\nmen-at-arms that guarded the outer way to the City of Nimmr. To his\\r\\nkeen ears was borne the sound of their voices long before he saw them.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as Sheeta or Numa approach their prey, so Tarzan of the Apes crept\\r\\nthrough the brush until he lay within a few yards of the men-at-arms.\\r\\nTo his vast astonishment he heard them conversing in a quaint form of\\r\\nEnglish that, while understandable to him, seemed yet a foreign tongue.\\r\\nHe marvelled at their antiquated costumes and obsolete weapons, and in\\r\\nthem he saw an explanation of Blake\\'s disappearance and a suggestion of\\r\\nhis fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time Tarzan lay watching the two with steady, unblinking eyes--it\\r\\nmight have been Numa, himself, weighing the chances of a sudden charge.\\r\\nHe saw that each was armed with a sturdy pike and a sword. They could\\r\\nspeak English, after a fashion, therefore, he argued, they might\\r\\nbe able to give him word of Blake. But would they receive him in a\\r\\nfriendly spirit or would they attempt to set upon and slay him?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe determined that he could never ascertain what their attitude would\\r\\nbe by lying hidden among the brush, and so he gathered himself, as Numa\\r\\ndoes when he is about to spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two blacks were idly gossiping, their minds as far from thoughts of\\r\\ndanger as it were possible they could be, when suddenly without warning\\r\\nTarzan launched himself full upon the back of the nearer, hurling him\\r\\nto the ground. Before the other could gather his wits the ape-man had\\r\\ndragged his victim into the concealment of the bush from which he had\\r\\nsprung, while the fellow\\'s companion turned and fled in the direction\\r\\nof the tunnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man in Tarzan\\'s grasp fought and struggled to be free but the\\r\\nape-man held him as easily as he might have held a child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lie still,\" he advised, \"I shall not harm you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ods blud!\" cried the black. \"What manner of creature be thou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One who will not harm you if you will tell him the truth,\" replied\\r\\nTarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What wouldst thou know?\" demanded the black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A white man came this way many weeks ago. Where is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou speakest of Sir James?\" asked the soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir James!\" mused Tarzan and then he recollected that Blake\\'s first\\r\\nname was James. \"His name was James,\" he replied, \"James Blake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Verily, \\'tis the same,\" said the soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen him? Where is he now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He be defending the honor of Our Lord Jesus and the Knights of Nimmr\\r\\nin the Great Tourney in the lists upon the plain below the city, and\\r\\nhave ye come to wreak dispite upon our good Sir James thou wilt find\\r\\nmany doughty knights and men-at-arms who wilt take up the gage in his\\r\\nbehalf.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am his friend,\" said Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why didst thou leap upon me thus, if thou beest a friend to Sir\\r\\nJames?\" demanded the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know how you had received him or how you would receive me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A friend of Sir James will be received well in Nimmr,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan took the man\\'s sword from him and permitted him to rise--his\\r\\npike he had dropped before being dragged among the bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go before me and lead me to your master,\" commanded the ape-man, \"and\\r\\nremember that your life will be the forfeit that you must pay for\\r\\ntreachery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make me leave the road unguarded against the Saracens,\" begged\\r\\nthe man. \"Soon my companion will return with others and then I shall\\r\\nbeg them to take thee where thou wilt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" agreed the ape-man. They had not waited long before he\\r\\nheard the sound of hastening footsteps and a strange jingling and\\r\\nclanking that might have been caused by the shaking of many chains and\\r\\nthe striking against them of objects of metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterward he was surprised to see a white man clothed in chain\\r\\nmail and carrying a sword and buckler descending the trail at a trot, a\\r\\ndozen pike-men at his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell them to halt!\" commanded Tarzan, placing the point of the man\\'s\\r\\nsword in the small of his back. \"Tell them I would talk with them\\r\\nbefore they approach too closely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop, I pray thee!\" cried the fellow. \"This be a friend of Sir James,\\r\\nbut he wilt run me through with my own sword an\\' ye press him too\\r\\nclose. Parley with him, most noble sir knight, for I wouldst live at\\r\\nleast to know the result of the Great Tourney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knight halted a few paces from Tarzan and looked him up and down\\r\\nfrom feet to head. \"Thou art truly a friend to Sir James?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan nodded. \"I have been seeking him for days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And some mishap befell thee and thou lost thy apparel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man smiled. \"I go thus, in the jungle,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Art thou a sir knight and from the same country as Sir James?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an Englishman,\" replied Tarzan of the Apes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An Englishman! Thrice welcome then to Nimmr! I be Sir Bertram and a\\r\\ngood friend to Sir James.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I am called Tarzan,\" said the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thy rank?\" inquired Sir Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan was mystified by the strange manners and garb of his seemingly\\r\\nfriendly inquisitor, but he sensed that whatever the man might be he\\r\\ntook himself quite seriously and would be more impressed if he knew\\r\\nthat Tarzan was a man of position, and so he answered him truthfully,\\r\\nin his quiet way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A Viscount,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A peer of the realm!\" exclaimed Sir Bertram. \"Prince Gobred wilt be\\r\\no\\'er pleased to greet thee, Lord Tarzan. Come thou with me and I wilt\\r\\nfurnish thee with apparel that befits thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outer barbican Bertram took Tarzan into the quarters reserved\\r\\nfor the knight commanding the warders and kept him there while he\\r\\nsent his squire to the castle to fetch raiment and a horse, and while\\r\\nthey waited Bertram told Tarzan all that had befallen Blake since his\\r\\narrival in Nimmr and, too, much of the strange history of this unknown\\r\\nBritish colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the squire returned with the clothing it was found that it fitted\\r\\nthe ape-man well, for Bertram was a large man, and presently Tarzan\\r\\nof the Apes was garbed as a Knight of Nimmr and was riding down toward\\r\\nthe castle with Sir Bertram. Here the knight announced him at the gate\\r\\nas the Lord Viscount Tarzan. Once within he introduced him to another\\r\\nknight whom he persuaded to relieve him at the gate while he conducted\\r\\nTarzan to the lists that he might be presented to Gobred and witness\\r\\nthe final scenes of the tourney, were it not concluded before they\\r\\narrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was that Tarzan of the Apes, clad in chain mail, and armed\\r\\nwith lance and sword, rode down into the Valley of the Sepulcher\\r\\njust as Bohun put his foul scheme into execution and carried off the\\r\\nPrincess Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before they reached the lists Bertram was aware that something was\\r\\namiss, for they could see the dust clouds racing rapidly north away\\r\\nfrom the lists as though one body of knights pursued another. He put\\r\\nspur to his mount and Tarzan followed suit, and so they came at a stiff\\r\\nrun to the lists and there they found all pandemonium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women were mounting preparatory to riding back to Nimmr under\\r\\nescort of a few knights that Gobred had sent back to guard them. The\\r\\nmen-at-arms were forming themselves into companies, but all was being\\r\\ndone in a confused manner since every now and then a great part of the\\r\\ncompany would rush to the highest part of the stands and peer off\\r\\ntoward the north after the clouds of dust that revealed nothing to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Bertram accosted one of his fellows. \"What hath befallen?\" he\\r\\ndemanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bohun hath seized the Princess Guinalda and carried her away,\" came\\r\\nthe astounding reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zounds!\" cried Bertram, reining about. \"Wilt ride with me in the\\r\\nservice of our princess, Lord Tarzan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Tarzan spurred his horse alongside of Bertram\\'s and stirrup\\r\\nto stirrup the two set out across the plain, while far ahead of them\\r\\nBlake drew gradually closer and closer to the fleeing Knights of the\\r\\nSepulcher. So thick the cloud of dust they threw up that they were hid\\r\\nfrom their pursuer even as he was hid from them and so were unaware\\r\\nthat Blake was near them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American carried no lance nor shield, but his sword clattered and\\r\\nclashed at his side and at his right hip swung his forty-five. Whenever\\r\\nhe had been armed, since he entered Nimmr, he had carried this weapon\\r\\nof another world and another age. To their queries he had answered that\\r\\nit was but a lucky talisman that he carried, but in his heart was the\\r\\nthought that some day it might stand him in better stead than these\\r\\nsimple knights and ladies could dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew that he would never use it except in battle, or as a last\\r\\nresort against overwhelming odds or unfair tactics, but he was glad\\r\\nthat he carried it today as it might mean the difference between\\r\\nliberty and captivity for the woman he loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly he drew closer to the rearmost Knights of the Sepulcher. Their\\r\\nmounts bred and trained to the utmost endurance and to carry the great\\r\\nweight of man and mail kept to a brisk canter even after the first long\\r\\nspurt of speed that had carried them away from the lists of Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dust rolled up in clouds from iron-shod feet. Through it Blake\\r\\ngroped, catching vague glimpses of mounted men just ahead. The black,\\r\\npowerful, fleet, courageous, showed no sign of fatigue. The rider\\r\\ncarried his sword in his hand, ready. He was no longer a black knight,\\r\\nbut a gray. Bassinet, hauberk, all the rich caparisons of his horse,\\r\\nthe horse itself, were gray with dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake glimpsed a knight toward whom he was slowly drawing closer.\\r\\nThis knight was gray! Like a flash Blake realized the value of the\\r\\ncamouflage that chance had laid upon him. He might ride among them and\\r\\nthey would not suspect that he was not of them!\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly he sheathed his sword and pressed forward, but he edged off\\r\\na little from the knight before he passed him. Urging the black ever\\r\\na little faster Blake crept up through the ranks of Bohun\\'s knights.\\r\\nSomewhere a knight was carrying double and this knight he sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearer the head of the column he forged the greater became the\\r\\ndanger of discovery, for now the dust was less thick and men could\\r\\nsee farther, but yet his own armor, his face, the leopard skin of his\\r\\nbassinet were coated thick with gray and though knights peered intently\\r\\nat him as he passed none recognized him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce one hailed him. \"Is\\'t thou, Percival?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" replied Blake and spurred on a trifle faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, dimly, just ahead, he saw several knights bunched close and once\\r\\nhe thought he glimpsed the fluttering garments of a woman in their\\r\\nmidst. Pressing on, he drew close behind these and there, surrounded by\\r\\nknights, he saw a woman held before one of the riders.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing his sword he spurred straight between two knights who rode\\r\\nclose behind he who carried Guinalda, and as Blake passed he cut to the\\r\\nright and left and the two knights rolled from their saddles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a touch of the spurs the black leaped abreast the young knight that\\r\\nwas bearing off the princess. So quickly was the thing accomplished\\r\\nthat the knights who rode scarce an arm\\'s length from him had not the\\r\\ntime to realize what was occurring and prevent it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake slipped his left arm about the girl and at the same time thrust\\r\\nto the left above his left fore-arm, driving his blade far into the\\r\\nbody of the youthful knight. Then he spurred forward carrying Guinalda\\r\\nfrom the dead arms as the knight pitched headlong from his saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake\\'s sword was wrenched from his grasp, so far had he driven it into\\r\\nthe body of the man who dared commit this wrong against the woman Blake\\r\\nloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nCries of rage arose about him as knights spurred in pursuit and the\\r\\nblack ran free with no guiding hand upon the reins. A huge fellow\\r\\nloomed just at Blake\\'s rear and another was closing in from the other\\r\\nside. The first man swung his sword as he stood in his stirrups and the\\r\\nsecond was already reaching for Blake with his point.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange oaths were on their lips and their countenances were contorted\\r\\nby rage as they strove to have the life of the rash man who had almost\\r\\nthwarted them in their design, but that he could succeed they had not\\r\\nthe remotest belief, for he was one against a thousand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen something happened the like of which had never been known to them\\r\\nor their progenitors. A blue barreled forty-five flashed from the\\r\\nholster at Blake\\'s hip, there was a loud report and the knight upon\\r\\nBlake\\'s right rear lunged head foremost to the ground. Blake turned in\\r\\nhis saddle and shot the knight upon his other side between the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, the horses of other knights close by, who might have menaced\\r\\nhim, bolted, as did the great black that Blake bestrode; but while the\\r\\nAmerican was trying to replace his weapon in its holster and gather the\\r\\nreins in his right hand he leaned to the left and thus forced the horse\\r\\nslowly around toward the direction he wished him to go, Blake\\'s plan\\r\\nbeing to cut across the front of the Knights of the Sepulcher and then\\r\\nturn southward toward Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sure that Gobred and his followers must be close in pursuit, and\\r\\nthat it would be but a matter of minutes before he would have Guinalda\\r\\nsafe behind a thousand or more knights, any one of whom would lay down\\r\\nhis life for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Knights of the Sepulcher had spread out over a greater front\\r\\nthan Blake had anticipated, and now he saw them coming rapidly upon his\\r\\nleft and was forced to swerve in a more northerly direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloser and closer they came and once more the American found it\\r\\nnecessary to drop his reins and draw his forty-five. One shot sent\\r\\nthe horses of the menacing knights rearing and plunging away from the\\r\\nterrifying sound, and it sent the black into a new paroxysm of terror\\r\\nthat almost resulted in Blake and the girl being unhorsed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the man finally brought the animal again under control the dust\\r\\ncloud that marked the position of the Knights of the Sepulcher was far\\r\\nbehind, and close upon Blake\\'s left was a great forest, whose dark\\r\\ndepths offered concealment for the moment at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nReining quickly within Sir James drew up and gently lowered Guinalda to\\r\\nthe ground. Then he dismounted and tied the black to a tree, for Blake\\r\\nwas spent after what he had been through this day since his first entry\\r\\nupon the lists, and the black was spent as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slipped the housing and the heavy saddle from the horse\\'s back and\\r\\ntook the great bit from his mouth, replacing a portion of the housing\\r\\nto serve as a cooler until the horse should be less heated, nor once\\r\\ndid he glance at the princess until he had finished caring for his\\r\\nhorse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he turned and faced her. She was standing leaning against a tree,\\r\\nlooking at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art a brave, sir knight,\" she said softly, and then added,\\r\\narrogantly, \"but still a boor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake smiled, wanly. He was very tired and had no wish to argue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry to ask you to do it,\" he said, ignoring what she had said\\r\\nto him, \"but Sir Galahad here will have to be kept moving about a bit\\r\\nuntil he cools off and I\\'m too fagged to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess Guinalda looked at him in wide-eyed amazement. \"Ye--ye,\"\\r\\nshe stammered, \"ye mean that I should lead the beast? I, a princess!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t do it Guinalda,\" replied Blake. \"I tell you I\\'m just about all\\r\\nin, lugging all these skid chains about since sun rise. I guess you\\'ll\\r\\nhave to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have to! Durst thou command, knave?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Snap out of it girl!\" advised Blake curtly. \"I\\'m responsible for your\\r\\nsafety and it may all depend on this horse. Get busy, and do as I tell\\r\\nyou! Lead him back and forth slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were tears of rage in the eyes of the Princess Guinalda as she\\r\\nprepared to make an angry retort, but there was something in Blake\\'s\\r\\neyes that silenced her. She looked at him for a long moment and then\\r\\nturned and walked to the black. Untying the rope that tethered him to\\r\\nthe tree she led him slowly to and fro, while Blake sat with his back\\r\\nagainst a great tree and watched out across the plain for the first\\r\\nsign of pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no pursuit, for the knights of Nimmr had overtaken the\\r\\nKnights of the Sepulcher and the two forces were engaging in a running\\r\\nfight that was leading them farther and farther away toward the City of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher upon the north side of the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinalda led the black for half an hour. She led him in silence and in\\r\\nsilence Blake sat gazing out across the valley. Presently he turned\\r\\ntoward the girl and rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'ll be good,\" he said, approaching her. \"Thank you. I\\'ll rub him a\\r\\nbit now. I was too exhausted to do it before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word she turned the black over to him and with dry leaves he\\r\\nrubbed the animal from muzzle to dock. When he had finished he threw\\r\\nthe housing over him again and came and sat down beside the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe let his eyes wander to her profile--to her straight nose, her short\\r\\nupper lip, her haughty chin. \"She is beautiful,\" thought Blake, \"but\\r\\nselfish, arrogant and cruel.\" But when she turned her eyes toward him,\\r\\neven though they passed over him as though he had not been there, they\\r\\nseemed to belie all the other evidence against her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe noticed that her eyes were never quiet. Her glances roved from place\\r\\nto place, but most often into the depths of the wood and upward among\\r\\nthe branches of the trees. Once she started and turned suddenly to gaze\\r\\nintently into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Methought something moved within the wood,\" she said. \"Let us be gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is almost dusk,\" he replied. \"When it is dark we can ride to Nimmr\\r\\nin safety. Some of Bohun\\'s knights may still be searching for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" she exclaimed. \"Remain here until dark? Knowest thou not where\\r\\nwe be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, what\\'s wrong with this place?\" demanded the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned toward him, her eyes wide with terror. \"It be the Wood of\\r\\nthe Leopards!\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes?\" he queried casually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here lair the great leopards of Nimmr,\" she continued, \"and after\\r\\nnight falls only a camp with many guards and beast fires be safe\\r\\nfrom them. And even so not always then, for they have been known to\\r\\nleap upon a warder and, dragging him into the wood, devour him within\\r\\nhearing of the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" suddenly her eyes responded to a new thought, \"I hadst forgot\\r\\nthe strange, roaring weapon with which thou slew the knights of Bohun!\\r\\nOf a surety with that thou couldst slay all the leopards of the wood!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake hesitated to undeceive her and add to her alarm. \"Perhaps,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"it will be as well to start now, for we have a long ride and it\\r\\nwill soon be dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he started toward Sir Galahad. He had almost reached the\\r\\nhorse when the animal suddenly raised its head and with up pricked\\r\\nears and dilated nostrils looked into the gathering shadows of the\\r\\nwood. For an instant Sir Galahad trembled like a leaf and then, with a\\r\\nwild snort, he lay back with all his weight upon the tether, and as it\\r\\nparted with a snap he wheeled and raced out upon the plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake drew his gun and peered into the wood, but he saw nothing nor\\r\\ncould his atrophied sense of smell catch the scent that had come so\\r\\nclearly to the nostrils of Sir Galahad.\\r\\n\\r\\nEyes that he could not see were watching him, but they were not the\\r\\neyes of Sheeta the leopard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \"_I Love You!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Tarzan rode with Sir Bertram in the wake of the Knights of Nimmr,\\r\\nnor did they overtake them until after Blake had borne Guinalda out\\r\\nof the battle which had followed immediately the hosts of Gobred had\\r\\noverhauled the Knights of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the two approached, Tarzan saw opposing knights paired off in mortal\\r\\ncombat. He saw a Knight of Nimmr go down before an adversary\\'s lance\\r\\nand then the victor espied Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have at you, sir knight!\" cried he of the Sepulcher, and couched his\\r\\nlance and put spurs to his charger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a new experience for the ape-man, a new adventure, a new\\r\\nthrill. He knew as much about jousting as he did about ping-pong, but\\r\\nfrom childhood he had wielded a spear, and so he smiled as the knight\\r\\ncharged upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Tarzan waited, and the Knight of the Sepulcher was disconcerted\\r\\nto see his adversary awaiting him, motionless, his spear not even\\r\\ncouched to receive him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Bertram had reined in his horse to watch the combat and observe\\r\\nhow this English peer accounted for himself in battle and he too was\\r\\nperplexed. Was the man mad, or was he fearful of the issue?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his antagonist approached him, Tarzan rose in his stirrups and\\r\\ncarried his lance hand above and behind his head, and when the tip of\\r\\nthe other\\'s lance was yet five paces from him the ape-man launched the\\r\\nheavy weapon as he had so often launched his hunting spear and his war\\r\\nspear in the chase and in battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not Viscount Greystoke who faced the Knight of the Sepulcher; it\\r\\nwas not the king of the great apes. It was the chief of the Waziri, and\\r\\nno other arm in the world could cast a war spear as could his.\\r\\n\\r\\nForward his spear hand shot, straight as an arrow sped the great lance.\\r\\nIt struck the shield of the Knight of the Sepulcher just above the boss\\r\\nand, splitting the heavy wood, drove into the heart of Tarzan\\'s foe,\\r\\nand at the same instant the ape-man reined his horse aside as that of\\r\\nhis fallen antagonist thundered past.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Bertram shook his head and spurred to meet an antagonist that had\\r\\njust challenged him. He was not sure that the act of Lord Tarzan had\\r\\nbeen entirely ethical, but he had to admit that it had been magnificent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fortunes of the battle carried Tarzan toward the west. His lance\\r\\ngone, he fought with his sword. Luck and his great strength and\\r\\nwondrous agility carried him through two encounters. By this time the\\r\\nbattle had drawn off toward the northeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan had accounted for his second man since he had lost his lance\\r\\nand a Knight of the Sepulcher had slain a Knight of Nimmr. Now these\\r\\ntwo remained alone upon the field, nor did the other lose a moment in\\r\\nshouting his challenge to the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in his life had Tarzan seen such fierce, bold men, such gluttons\\r\\nfor battle. That they glorified in conflict and in death with a fierce\\r\\nlust that surpassed the maddest fanaticism he had ever witnessed filled\\r\\nTarzan\\'s breast with admiration. What men! What warriors!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the last knight was upon him. Their swords clashed on ready\\r\\nbuckler. They wheeled and turned and struck again. They passed and\\r\\nspurred once more to close quarters. Each rose in his stirrups to\\r\\ndeliver a terrifying cut, each sought to cleave the other\\'s skull.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blade of the Knight of the Sepulcher glanced from Tarzan\\'s buckler\\r\\nand bit into the skull of the ape-man\\'s charger, but Tarzan\\'s edge\\r\\nsmote true.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his horse went down Tarzan leaped free, his antagonist falling dead\\r\\nat his feet, while the riderless horse of the slain knight galloped\\r\\nswiftly off in the direction in which lay the City of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan looked about him. He was alone upon the field. Far to the north\\r\\nand east he saw the dust of battle. The City of Nimmr lay across the\\r\\nplain toward the south. When the battle was over it was there that\\r\\nBlake would ride and it was Blake whom Tarzan wanted to find. The sun\\r\\nwas sinking behind the western hills as Tarzan turned toward Nimmr.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain mail that he wore was heavy, hot and uncomfortable, and\\r\\nTarzan had not gone far before he discarded it. He had his knife and\\r\\nhis rope. These he always kept with him, but he left the sword with the\\r\\narmor and with a sigh of relief continued on his way.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad, as he had come across the valley from the City of the\\r\\nSepulcher toward the city that he had seen upon the opposite side, had\\r\\nbeen perturbed by the great clouds of dust that had been raised by the\\r\\nKnights of the Sepulcher and the pursuing Nimmrians.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing a forest close upon his right hand he had thought it wiser\\r\\nto seek its concealing shadows until he could learn more concerning\\r\\nthat which caused so great a dust cloud, which he saw was rapidly\\r\\napproaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the forest it was cool and here Ibn Jad and his followers rested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us remain here,\" suggested Abd el-Aziz, \"until evening, when we\\r\\nmay approach the city under cover of darkness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad approved the plan and so they camped just within the forest and\\r\\nwaited. They watched the dust cloud pass and continue on toward the\\r\\nCity of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah, it is well we did escape that village before yon host\\r\\nreturned,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey saw a horseman enter the forest, or pass to the south of it--they\\r\\ncould not know which--but they were not interested in single horsemen,\\r\\nor in any horseman, so they did not investigate. He seemed to be either\\r\\ncarrying another person upon his horse with him, or some great bundle.\\r\\nAt a distance they could not see which.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Abd el-Aziz, \"we shall find greater treasure in the\\r\\ncity to the south.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And perhaps the beautiful woman of whom the sahar spoke,\" added Ibn\\r\\nJad, \"for she was not within the city we left this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some there that were beautiful,\" said Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The one I seek is more beautiful than an houri,\" said Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they took up their march again just before dark they moved\\r\\ncautiously just within the edge of the forest. They had covered a\\r\\nmile, perhaps, when those in the lead heard voices ahead. Ibn Jad sent\\r\\none to investigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was soon back. His eyes were bright with excitement. \"Ibn Jad,\"\\r\\nhe whispered, \"thou needst seek no farther--the houri is just ahead!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the suggestion of the scout Ibn Jad, followed by his\\r\\ncompanions, went deeper into the woods and approached Blake and\\r\\nGuinalda from the west. When Sir Galahad broke loose and Blake drew\\r\\nhis forty-five Ibn Jad knew that they could remain in concealment no\\r\\nlonger. He called Fahd to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many of the Nasranys speak the language thou didst learn among the\\r\\nsoldiers of the North,\" he said. \"Speak thou therefore to this one in\\r\\nthe same tongue, telling him we are friends and that we are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Fahd saw the Princess Guinalda his eyes narrowed and he trembled\\r\\nalmost as might a man with ague. Never in his life had Fahd seen so\\r\\nbeautiful a woman, never had he dreamed that an houri might be so\\r\\nlovely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not fire upon us,\" he called to Blake from the concealment of some\\r\\nbushes. \"We are friends. We are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Blake, surprised to hear French spoken in the\\r\\nValley of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We be poor men from the desert country,\" replied Fahd. \"We are lost.\\r\\nHelp us to find our way and the blessings of Allah shall be upon thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come out and let me see you,\" said Blake. \"If you are friendly you\\r\\nneed not fear me. I\\'ve had all the trouble I\\'m looking for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd and Ibn Jad stepped out into view and at sight of them Guinalda\\r\\nvoiced a little scream and seized Blake\\'s arm. \"The Saracens!\" she\\r\\ngasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess they\\'re Saracens all right,\" said Blake, \"but you needn\\'t\\r\\nworry--they won\\'t hurt you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not harm a crusader?\" she demanded incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These fellows never heard of a crusader.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Melikes not the way they look at me,\" whispered Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, neither do I, but perhaps they mean no harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith many smiles the Arabs gathered around the two and through Fahd Ibn\\r\\nJad repeated his protestations of friendship and his delight at meeting\\r\\none who could direct him from the valley. He asked many questions about\\r\\nthe City of Nimmr; and all the while his followers pressed closer to\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf a sudden the smiles vanished from their faces as, at a signal from\\r\\ntheir sheik, four stalwart Beduins leaped upon the American and bore\\r\\nhim to the ground, snatching his gun from him, while simultaneously two\\r\\nothers seized the Princess Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment Blake was securely bound and the \\'Aarab were debating what\\r\\ndisposition to make of him. Several wanted to slit his throat, but Ibn\\r\\nJad counseled against it since they were in a valley filled with the\\r\\nman\\'s friends and should the fortunes of war decide to throw some of\\r\\nthe Beduins into the hands of the enemy such would fare better if they\\r\\nspared this one\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake threatened, promised, begged that they give Guinalda her liberty,\\r\\nbut Fahd only laughed at him and spit upon him. For a time it seemed\\r\\nalmost certain that they were going to kill Blake, as one of the\\r\\nBeduins stood over him with a keen khusa in his hand, awaiting the word\\r\\nfrom Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that Guinalda tore free from those who held her and threw\\r\\nherself upon Blake to shield his body from the blade with her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shalt not slay him!\" she cried. \"Take my life an\\' thou must have\\r\\nChristian blood, but spare him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They cannot understand you, Guinalda,\" said Blake. \"Perhaps they will\\r\\nnot kill me, but that does not matter. You must escape them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they must not kill thee--they shall not! Canst ever forgive me the\\r\\ncruel words I spoke? I did not mean them. My pride was hurt that thou\\r\\nshouldst say of me what Malud told me thou didst say and so I spoke to\\r\\nhurt thee and not from my heart. Canst forgive me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive you? God love you, I could forgive you murder! But what did\\r\\nMalud tell you I had said?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mind not now. I care not what thou said. I tell thee I forgive it!\\r\\nSay to me again thy words that thou didst speak when I pinned my favor\\r\\nupon thy hauberk and I can forgive thee anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did Malud say?\" insisted Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That thou hadst bragged that thou wouldst win me and then cast my love\\r\\naside,\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cur! You must know that he lied, Guinalda.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say what I have asked and I shall know he lied,\" she insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love you! I love you, Guinalda!\" cried Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabs laid heavy hands upon the girl and dragged her to her feet.\\r\\nIbn Jad and the others still argued about the disposition to be made of\\r\\nBlake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Ullah!\" exclaimed the sheik, at last, \"we shall leave the Nasrany\\r\\nwhere he lies and if he die none can say that the Beduw did slay him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Abd el-Aziz,\" he continued, \"let thou take men and continue across the\\r\\nvalley to that other city. Come, I shall accompany you a way and we\\r\\nwill talk out of hearing of this Nasrany who, perchance, understandeth\\r\\nmore of our tongue than he would have us guess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they moved away toward the south Guinalda tried to free herself\\r\\nagain from the grasp of her captors, but they dragged her with them.\\r\\nUntil the last Blake saw her struggling and saw her dear face turned\\r\\ntoward him, and as they passed out of sight among the trees she called\\r\\nback through the falling night three words that meant more to him than\\r\\nall the languages of all the world combined: \"I love you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance from Blake the \\'Aarab halted. \"I leave thee here, Abd\\r\\nel-Aziz,\" said Ibn Jad. \"Go thou and see if the city appears to be a\\r\\nrich place, and if it be too strongly guarded make no attempt to loot\\r\\nit, but return to the menzil that will be just beyond the northern\\r\\nsummit where it now is, or, if we move it, we shall make our trail\\r\\nplain that you may follow us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall hasten from the valley with this rich treasure that we now\\r\\nhave, not the least of which is the woman. Billah! in the north she\\r\\nwill fetch the ransom of a dozen sheykh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, Abd el-Aziz, and may Allah be with thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad turned directly north. His belief that the great body of\\r\\nhorsemen he had glimpsed amid the distant dust were returning to the\\r\\ncity he had sacked argued against his attempting to leave the valley\\r\\nby the same route that he had entered it, and so he had determined to\\r\\nattempt to scale the steep mountains at a point west of the City of the\\r\\nSepulcher, avoiding the castle and its defenders entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake heard the retreating footsteps of the Beduins die away in the\\r\\ndistance. He struggled with his bonds, but the camel leather held\\r\\nsecurely. Then he lay quiet. How silent, how lonely the great, black\\r\\nwood--the Wood of the Leopards! Blake listened. Momentarily he expected\\r\\nto hear the fall of padded feet, the sound of a great, furred body\\r\\napproaching through the underbrush. The slow minutes dragged. An hour\\r\\nhad passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon rose--a great, swollen, red moon that floated silently up from\\r\\nbehind distant mountains. This moon was looking down upon Guinalda\\r\\nas it was on him. He whispered a message to it--a message for his\\r\\nprincess. It was the first time that Blake ever had been in love and he\\r\\nalmost forgot his bonds and the leopards in recalling those three words\\r\\nthat Guinalda had called back at the instant of their separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was that? Blake strained his eyes into the darkness of the shadowy\\r\\nwood. Something was moving! Yes, it was the sound of stealthy, padded\\r\\nfeet--the scraping of a furred body against leaves and twigs. The\\r\\nleopard of the wood was coming!\\r\\n\\r\\nHark! There must be another in a nearby tree, for he was sure that he\\r\\ncould see a shadowy form almost above him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moonlight, shining from the low moon near the eastern horizon,\\r\\ncrept beneath the trees and lighted the ground upon which Blake lay and\\r\\nbeyond him for a dozen yards and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently into this moonlit space stepped a great leopard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake saw the blazing eyes, felt them burning into him like fire. He\\r\\ncould not tear his own from the great snarling figure, where they were\\r\\nheld in awful fascination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carnivore crouched and crept closer. Inch by inch it crept upon him\\r\\nas though with the studied cruelty of premeditated torture. He saw the\\r\\nsinuous tail lashing from side to side. He saw the great fangs bared.\\r\\nHe saw the beast flatten against the ground, its muscles tensed. It was\\r\\nabout to spring! Helpless, horrified, Blake could not take his eyes\\r\\nfrom the hideous, snarling face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw it leap suddenly with the lightness and agility of a house cat,\\r\\nand at the same instant he saw something flash through the air. The\\r\\nleopard stopped in mid-leap and was jerked backward, and then Blake\\'s\\r\\nastonished eyes saw it being hauled upward into a tree that overhung\\r\\nthe spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw the shadowy form that he had seen before, but now he saw that it\\r\\nwas a man and that he was hauling the leopard upward by a rope that had\\r\\nbeen cast about its neck at the instant that it had risen to leap upon\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nScreaming, pawing with raking talons, Sheeta the leopard was dragged\\r\\nupward. A mighty hand reached out and grasped the great cat by the\\r\\nscruff of the neck and another hand drove a knife blade into the savage\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sheeta ceased to struggle, and hung quiet, the hand released its\\r\\ngrasp and the dead body of the carnivore thudded to the ground beside\\r\\nBlake. Then the god-like figure of an almost naked white man dropped\\r\\nlightly to the leafy mold.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake voiced an exclamation of surprised delight. \"Tarzan of the Apes!\"\\r\\nhe cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blake?\" demanded the ape-man, and then: \"At last! And I didn\\'t find\\r\\nyou much too soon, either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell the world you didn\\'t!\" exclaimed Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan cut the bonds that held the American.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been looking for me?\" asked Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ever since I learned that you had become separated from your safari.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By George, that was white of you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who left you trussed up here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bunch of Arabs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like a growl escaped the lips of the ape-man. \"That\\r\\nvillainous old Ibn Jad here?\" he demanded incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They took a girl who was with me,\" said Blake. \"I do not need to ask\\r\\nyou to help me rescue her, I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which way did they go?\" asked Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There.\" Blake pointed toward the south.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better shed that armor,\" advised Tarzan, \"it makes walking a\\r\\npunishment--I just tried it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the ape-man\\'s help Blake got out of his coat of mail and then the\\r\\ntwo set out upon the plain trail of the Arabs. At the point where Ibn\\r\\nJad had turned back toward the north they were at a loss to know which\\r\\nof the two spoors to follow, for here the footprints of Guinalda, that\\r\\nthe ape-man had been able to pick up from time to time since they left\\r\\nthe spot where the girl had been seized, disappeared entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wondered what had become of them. They could not know that here,\\r\\nwhen she found that Ibn Jad was going to turn back with her away from\\r\\nNimmr, she had refused to walk farther. It had been all right as long\\r\\nas they were approaching Nimmr, but she refused absolutely to be a\\r\\nparty to her own abduction when it led away from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat breeze there was was blowing from the east, nullifying the value\\r\\nof Tarzan\\'s sense of smell so that even the great ape-man could not\\r\\nknow in what direction or with which party Guinalda had been carried\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The most reasonable assumption,\" said Tarzan, \"is that your princess\\r\\nis with the party that has gone north, for I know that Ibn Jad\\'s menzil\\r\\nmust lay in that direction. He did not enter the valley from the south.\\r\\nThat I know because I just came in that way myself and Sir Bertram\\r\\nassured me that there are only two entrances--the one through which I\\r\\ncame and a pass above the City of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ibn Jad would want to get the girl out of the valley and into his\\r\\ncamp as soon as possible whether he is going to hold her for ransom or\\r\\ntake her north to sell her. The party that went south toward Nimmr may\\r\\nhave been sent to treat with her people for a ransom; but the chances\\r\\nare that she is not with that party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, it is at best but a matter of conjecture. We must ascertain\\r\\ndefinitely, and I suggest that you follow the northern spoor, which is,\\r\\nI am certain, the one that will lead to the girl, while I overtake the\\r\\nparty to the south.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can travel faster than you and if I am right and the girl is with\\r\\nthe northern party I\\'ll turn back and overtake you without much loss\\r\\nof time. If you catch up with the other band and find the girl is not\\r\\nwith them, you can turn back and join me; but if she is with them you\\'d\\r\\nbetter not risk trying to recover her until you have help, for you are\\r\\nunarmed and those Beduins would think no more of cutting your throat\\r\\nthan they would of drinking a cup of coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, good-bye and good luck!\" And Tarzan of the Apes was off at a trot\\r\\nupon the trail of the party that had gone in the direction of Nimmr,\\r\\nwhile Blake turned northward to face a dismal journey through the black\\r\\ndepths of the Wood of the Leopards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n                 \"_For Every Jewel a Drop of Blood!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night Ibn Jad and his party marched northward. Though they were\\r\\nhampered by the refusal of Guinalda to walk, yet they made rapid\\r\\nprogress for they were spurred on by their great desire to escape from\\r\\nthe valley with their booty before they should be discovered and set\\r\\nupon by the great host of fighting men they were now convinced were\\r\\nquartered in the castle and city they had been fortunate enough to find\\r\\nalmost deserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvarice gave them strength and endurance far beyond that which they\\r\\nnormally displayed, with the result that dawn found them at the foot of\\r\\nthe ragged mountains that Ibn Jad had determined to scale rather than\\r\\nattempt an assault upon the castle which guarded the easy way from the\\r\\nvalley.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a jaded party that won eventually to the pass just above the\\r\\nouter barbican that guarded the road to the City of the Sepulcher, nor\\r\\nwere they discovered by the warders there until the last man of them\\r\\nwas safely on the trail leading to the low saddle at the summit of the\\r\\nmountains, beyond which lay the menzil of the Beduins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defenders of the barbican made a sortie against them and approached\\r\\ntheir rear so closely that the sir knight who commanded saw Guinalda\\r\\nand recognized her, but a volley from the matchlocks of the desert\\r\\npeople sent the crudely armed soldiers of Bohun back in retreat, though\\r\\nthe brave knight couched his lance and charged again until his horse\\r\\nwas brought down by a bullet and he lay pinned beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was afternoon before Ibn Jad with his fagged company staggered into\\r\\nthe menzil. Though they dropped in their tracks from sheer exhaustion,\\r\\nhe allowed them but an hour of sleep before he gave the signal for\\r\\nthe rahla, for the sheik of the fendy el-Guad was filled with an ever\\r\\nincreasing fear that the treasure and the woman would be taken away\\r\\nfrom him before he could reach the sandy wastes of his own barren beled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy weight of the treasure had been divided into several bundles\\r\\nand these were distributed among his least mistrusted followers, while\\r\\nthe custody of the girl captive was placed in the hands of Fahd, whose\\r\\nevil eyes filled the princess with fear and loathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol, who had secretly scoffed at the stories of treasure and the\\r\\nmad tales of a beautiful woman that the \\'Aarab expected to find in\\r\\nsome fabulous, hidden city, was dumfounded when he viewed the spoils\\r\\nof the Beduin raid, and at first was inclined to attribute them to the\\r\\nhallucinations of his fever-racked brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeak, Stimbol staggered feebly along the trail, keeping as close to\\r\\nFahd as he could, for he knew that of all the company this unscrupulous\\r\\nscoundrel would be most likely to assist him, for to Fahd a live\\r\\nStimbol meant great wealth; nor was Fahd unmindful of the fact. And\\r\\nnow there was another purpose in the evil mind of the Beduin who had\\r\\nconceived for the white girl an infatuation that was driving him to the\\r\\nverge of madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the wealth that Stimbol had promised him Fahd realized that he\\r\\ncould afford to possess this lovely houri whom otherwise a poor Beduwy\\r\\nmust sell for the great price that she would bring, and so there\\r\\nrevolved in the mind of Fahd many schemes whereby he might hope to gain\\r\\nsole possession of both Guinalda and Stimbol; but always there loomed\\r\\nin the path of every plan that he considered the dour figure of his\\r\\ngreedy sheykh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foot of the Mountains of the Sepulcher Ibn Jad turned toward\\r\\nthe east, thus to avoid passing again through the country of Batando.\\r\\nBeyond the eastern end of the range he would turn south again and later\\r\\nstrike west just above the northern limits of the territory that was\\r\\nnominally Tarzan\\'s, for though he knew that the Lord of the Jungle was\\r\\ndead he yet feared the vengeance of his people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late before Ibn Jad made camp. The preparations for the evening\\r\\nmeal were hurried. The light from the cooking fire and the paper\\r\\nlanterns in the beyt of the sheik was dim and flickering, yet not so\\r\\ndim but that Ateja saw Fahd drop something into the bowl of food that\\r\\nshe had prepared for Ibn Jad and which stood upon the ground between\\r\\nhim and his would-be assassin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sheik reached for the receptacle Ateja stepped from the women\\'s\\r\\nquarters and struck it from his hand, but before she could explain\\r\\nher act or charge Fahd with his villainy the culprit, realizing that\\r\\nhis perfidy had been discovered, leaped to his feet and seizing his\\r\\nmatchlock sprang into the women\\'s quarters where Guinalda had been left\\r\\nunder the watchful care of Hirfa and Ateja.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeizing the girl by the wrist and dragging her after him Fahd broke\\r\\nthrough the curtains at the rear of the beyt and ran in the direction\\r\\nof his own tent. By this time the mukaad of Ibn Jad was in an uproar.\\r\\nThe sheik was demanding an explanation from Ateja and still unaware\\r\\nthat Fahd had escaped through the rear of the beyt no one had followed\\r\\nhim into the women\\'s quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He placed _simm_ in thy food!\" cried Ateja. \"I saw him and the proof\\r\\nof it be that he fled when he knew that I had seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billah,\" exclaimed Ibn Jad. \"The son of a jackal would poison me?\\r\\nSeize him and fetch him to me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hath fled through the beyt!\" cried Hirfa, \"and taken the Nasrawia\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beduins sprang to their feet and took after Fahd, but at his own\\r\\nbeyt he stopped them with a bullet and they retreated. In his tent he\\r\\nseized Stimbol who was lying upon a filthy sleeping mat and dragged him\\r\\nto his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hasten!\" he hissed in the American\\'s ear. \"Ibn Jad has ordered that\\r\\nthou be slain! Quick! follow me and I will save thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Fahd had recourse to the rear curtains of a beyt and as his\\r\\nfellows approached the front in anger but with caution, Fahd, dragging\\r\\nGuinalda and followed by Stimbol, sneaked through the darkness of the\\r\\nmenzil and turned toward the west.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dusk when James Blake, following the plain trail of Ibn Jad,\\r\\nfinally clambered over the last escarpment and stood upon the trail\\r\\nthat led through the pass toward the outer world beyond the Valley of\\r\\nthe Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred yards to his right loomed the gray towers of the barbican, to\\r\\nhis left was the trail that led in the direction of his heart\\'s desire,\\r\\nand all about him, concealed in the bushes, were the men-at-arms of\\r\\nKing Bohun of the Sepulcher; but this he did not guess, for how could\\r\\nhe know that for hours the eyes of the warders had been watching his\\r\\nslow ascent toward the pass trail?\\r\\n\\r\\nSpent by the long climb following hours of gruelling exertion without\\r\\nfood or rest, unarmed, Blake was helpless to resist or to attempt\\r\\nescape when a dozen armed men stepped from the surrounding bushes and\\r\\nencircled him in a band of steel. And so Sir James of Nimmr was seized\\r\\nand hauled before King Bohun, and when he was questioned and Bohun\\r\\nfound that he was the same black knight that had thwarted his plan to\\r\\nabduct the Princess Guinalda he could scarce contain himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuring Blake only of the fact that he would be put to death as soon\\r\\nas Bohun could determine upon a fate commensurate with the heinousness\\r\\nof the crime, the king ordered him to be placed in chains, and the\\r\\nAmerican was led away by guards to a black hole beneath the castle,\\r\\nwhere by the light of flares a smith forged a heavy iron band about one\\r\\nankle and he was chained to a damp stone wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of the flare Blake saw two emaciated, naked creatures\\r\\nsimilarly chained, and in a far corner glimpsed a skeleton among the\\r\\nbones of which rusted a length of chain and a great anklet. Then\\r\\nsilently the guards and the smith departed, taking the flares with\\r\\nthem, and James Blake was left in darkness and despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the plain, below the City of Nimmr, Tarzan had overtaken the party\\r\\nof Beduins led by Abd el-Aziz, and after assuring himself that the girl\\r\\nwas not with them he had turned without revealing himself to them and\\r\\nhurried northward to take up the trail of the other party.\\r\\n\\r\\nRequiring food and rest he lay up in the Wood of the Leopards during\\r\\nthe heat of the day after stalking Horta the boar and making a quick\\r\\nkill. His belly filled, the ape-man found a high flung tree crotch\\r\\nwhere there was little likelihood of the heavy leopards of Nimmr\\r\\ndisturbing his slumbers, and here he slept until the sun was sinking\\r\\nbehind the western mountains. Early the following morning he reached\\r\\nthe deserted menzil where Ibn Jad\\'s people had camped during his\\r\\nincursion of the Valley of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time since, he had lost the spoor of Blake, but that of the girl\\r\\nfrequently recurred, and as her rescue now took precedence over other\\r\\nconsiderations he followed doggedly along the trail of Ibn Jad. For a\\r\\ntime he was mystified by the fact that Guinalda\\'s spoor, well marked\\r\\nby the imprints of the tiny sandals of medieval design, did not appear\\r\\namong the footprints of those who left the Beduin menzil.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lost some time searching about in an effort to discover a clew to\\r\\nthe riddle and presently he hit upon the truth, which lay in the fact\\r\\nthat Guinalda\\'s light sandals having been badly worn by her journey\\r\\nand far too tight for comfortable walking she had been given a pair\\r\\nbelonging to Ateja, and thus it became difficult to differentiate\\r\\nbetween the spoor of the two girls, who were of equal weight and of\\r\\na similarity of carriage that rendered their footprints practically\\r\\nidentical.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan therefore contented himself with following the spoor of the\\r\\nparty, and so it was that he passed their first night\\'s camp, where\\r\\nFahd had stolen Guinalda from the sheik, without discovering that three\\r\\nof its members had there turned to the west, while the main body of the\\r\\n\\'Aarab marched toward the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Tarzan followed the spoor of Ibn Jad a hundred stalwart Waziri\\r\\nmoved northward from the water hole of the smooth, round rocks upon the\\r\\nold trail of the Beduins. With them was Zeyd, who had begged so hard to\\r\\naccompany them when they passed the village where he had been waiting\\r\\nthat at last the sub-chief had consented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tarzan overtook the \\'Aarab they had already turned south around\\r\\nthe eastern end of the Mountains of the Sepulcher. He saw the bags they\\r\\ncarried and the evident concern with which Ibn Jad watched and guarded\\r\\nthem, and he shrewdly guessed that the wily old thief had indeed found\\r\\nthe treasure he had sought; but he saw no evidence of the presence of\\r\\nthe Princess, and Stimbol, too, was missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan was furious. He was furious at the thieving Beduins for daring\\r\\nto invade his country and he was furious at himself because he felt\\r\\nthat in some way he had been tricked.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan had his own methods of inflicting punishment upon his enemies\\r\\nand he had, as well, his own grim and grisly sense of humor. When men\\r\\nwere doing wrong it pleased him to take advantage of whatever might\\r\\ncause them the greatest suffering and in this he was utterly ruthless\\r\\nwith his enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was confident that the \\'Aarab thought him dead and it did not\\r\\nsuit his whim to reveal their error to them at this time, but it did\\r\\naccord with his fancy to let them commence to feel the weight of his\\r\\ndispleasure and taste the first fruits of their villainy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving silently through the trees Tarzan paralleled the course of the\\r\\n\\'Aarab. They were often plainly visible to him; but none saw Tarzan,\\r\\nnor dreamed that savage eyes were watching their every move.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive men carried the treasure, though its weight was not so great but\\r\\nthat one powerful man might have borne it for a short distance. Tarzan\\r\\nwatched these men most often, these and the Sheik Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trail was wide and the sheik walked beside one of those who bore\\r\\nthe treasure. It was very quiet in the jungle. Even the \\'Aarab,\\r\\ngarrulous among themselves, were quiet, for they were very tired and\\r\\nthe day was hot and they were unused to the burdens they were forced to\\r\\ncarry since Batando had robbed them of their slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf a sudden, without warning and with only the swish of its flight\\r\\nthrough the air to announce it, an arrow passed through the neck of\\r\\nthe Beduin who walked beside Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a scream the man lunged forward upon his face and the \\'Aarab,\\r\\nwarned by their sheik, cocked their muskets and prepared to receive an\\r\\nattack, but look where they would they saw no sign of an enemy. They\\r\\nwaited, listening, but there was no sound other than the droning of\\r\\ninsects and the occasional raucous cry of a bird; but when they moved\\r\\non again, leaving their fellow dead upon the trail, a hollow voice\\r\\ncalled to them from a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_For every jewel a drop of blood!_\" it wailed dismally, for its author\\r\\nknew well the intensely superstitious nature of the desert dwellers and\\r\\nhow best to affright them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a shaken column that continued on its way, nor was there any\\r\\nmention of making camp until almost sunset, so anxious were they all to\\r\\nleave behind this gloomy wood and the horrid afrit that inhabited it;\\r\\nbut the forest persisted and at length it became necessary to make camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the camp fires and food relieved the tension upon their\\r\\noverwrought nerves, and their spirits had revived to such an extent\\r\\nthat there were again singing and laughter in the menzil of Ibn Jad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old sheik himself sat in his mukaad surrounded by the five bags of\\r\\ntreasure, one of which he had opened and beneath the light of a lantern\\r\\nwas fondling the contents. About him were his cronies, sipping their\\r\\ncoffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly something fell heavily upon the ground before the beyt and\\r\\nrolled into the mukaad among them. It was the severed head of a man!\\r\\nGlaring up at them were the dead eyes of their fellow, whose corpse\\r\\nthey had left lying in the trail earlier in the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorror struck, spellbound, they sat staring at the gruesome thing when,\\r\\nfrom out of the dark forest, came the hollow voice again: \"_For every\\r\\njewel a drop of blood!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad shook as a man with ague. The men of the camp gathered close\\r\\ntogether in front of the beyt of the sheik. Each grasped a musket in\\r\\none hand and searched for his hijab with the other, for each carried\\r\\nseveral of these amulets, and that in demand this night was the one\\r\\nwritten against the jan, for certainly none but a jin could have done\\r\\nthis thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHirfa stood half within the mukaad staring at the dead face of her\\r\\nfellow while Ateja crouched upon a sleeping mat in the quarters of the\\r\\nwomen. She did not see the back curtain rise, nor the figure that crept\\r\\nwithin. It was dark in the quarters of the hareem since little light\\r\\nfiltered in from the lanterns in the mukaad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAteja felt a hand clapped across her mouth at the same instant that\\r\\nanother grasped her by the shoulder. A voice whispered in her ear.\\r\\n\"Make no sound! I shall not hurt thee. I am a friend to Zeyd. Tell me\\r\\nthe truth and no harm will befall you or him. Where is the woman Ibn\\r\\nJad brought from the valley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who held her placed his ear close to her lips and removed his hand\\r\\nfrom them. Ateja trembled like a leaf. She had never seen a jin. She\\r\\ncould not see the creature that leaned close to her, but she knew that\\r\\nit was one of those fearsome creatures of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Answer!\" whispered the voice in her ear. \"If thou wouldst save Zeyd,\\r\\nspeak and speak the truth!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fahd took the woman from our menzil last night,\" she gasped. \"I do not\\r\\nknow where they went.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it came, in silence the presence left the side of the terrified\\r\\ngirl. When Hirfa sought her a moment later she found her in a swoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _Bride of the Ape_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake squatted upon the stone floor in the utter darkness of his\\r\\ndungeon. After his jailers had left he had spoken to his fellow\\r\\nprisoners, but only one had replied and his jibbering tones assured the\\r\\nAmerican that the poor wretch had been reduced to stark insanity by the\\r\\nhorrors of imprisonment in this foul hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man, accustomed to freedom, light, activity, already felt the\\r\\nhideousness of his position and wondered how long it would be before\\r\\nhe, too, jibbered incoherently at the end of a rusting chain, how long\\r\\nbefore he, too, was but mildewed bones upon a clammy floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn utter darkness and in utter silence there is no time, for there is\\r\\nno means by which one may compute the passage of time. How long Blake\\r\\ncrouched in the stifling air of his dank dungeon he could not know. He\\r\\nslept once, but whether he had dozed for an instant or slept the clock\\r\\naround he could not even hazard a guess. And of what moment was it? A\\r\\nsecond, a day, a year meant nothing here. There were only two things\\r\\nthat could mean anything to Jim Blake now--freedom or death. He knew\\r\\nthat it would not be long before he would welcome the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sound disturbed the silence of the buried vault. Footsteps were\\r\\napproaching. Blake listened as they came nearer. Presently he\\r\\ndiscerned a flickering light that grew in intensity until a pine torch\\r\\nilluminated the interior of his prison. At first it blinded his eyes so\\r\\nthat he could not see who came, bearing the light, but whoever it was\\r\\ncrossed and stopped before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake looked up, his eyes more accustomed to the unwonted brilliance,\\r\\nand saw two knights standing before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It be he,\" said one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost thou not know us, Sir Black Knight?\" demanded the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake looked at them closely. A slow smile lighted his face, as he saw\\r\\na great bandage wrapped about the neck of the younger man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" he said, \"here is where I get mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get thine! What meanest thou?\" demanded the older man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you two certainly haven\\'t come to pin any medals on me, Sir\\r\\nWildred,\" said Blake, with a wry smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou speakest in riddles,\" said Wildred. \"We have come to free thee\\r\\nthat the young king may not bring disgrace upon the Knights of the\\r\\nSepulcher by carrying out his wicked will with thee. Sir Guy and I\\r\\nheard that he would burn thee at the stake, and we said to one another\\r\\nthat while blood flowed in our bodies we would not let so valorous a\\r\\nknight be thus shamelessly wronged by any tyrant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke Wildred stooped and with a great rasp commenced filing upon\\r\\nthe iron rivets that held the hinged anklet in place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going to help me to escape!\" exclaimed Blake. \"But suppose you\\r\\nare discovered--will not the king punish you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall not be discovered,\" said Wildred, \"though I would take that\\r\\nchance for so noble a sir knight as thee. Sir Guy be upon the outer\\r\\nbarbican this night and \\'twill be no trick to get thee that far. He can\\r\\npass thee through and thou canst make thy way down the mountain side\\r\\nand cross to Nimmr. We cannot get thee through the city gates for these\\r\\nbe held by two of Bohun\\'s basest creatures, but perchance upon the\\r\\nmorrow Sir Guy or I may find the way to ride out upon the plain with a\\r\\nled horse, and that we shall if so it hap that it be possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell us of a thing that hath filled us with questioning,\" said Sir Guy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t follow you,\" said Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou didst, and mighty prettily too, take the Princess Guinalda from\\r\\nunder the very nose of Bohun,\" continued Guy, \"and yet later she was\\r\\nseen in the clutches of the Saracens. How came this to pass?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was seen?\" demanded Blake. \"Where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond the outer barbican she was and the Saracens carried her away\\r\\nthrough the pass that leadeth no man knoweth where,\" said Wildred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake told them of all that had transpired since he had taken Guinalda\\r\\nfrom Bohun, and by the time he had finished the rivets had been cut and\\r\\nhe stood again a free man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWildred smuggled him through secret passages to his own quarters and\\r\\nthere gave him food and new clothing and a suit of armor, for now that\\r\\nthey knew he was riding out over the pass into the strange country they\\r\\nhad decided that he could only be permitted to do so properly armored,\\r\\narmed and mounted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was midnight when Wildred smuggled Blake through the castle gate\\r\\nand rode with him toward the outer barbican. Here Sir Guy met them and\\r\\na few minutes later Blake bid these chivalrous enemies good-bye and,\\r\\nmounted on a powerful charger, his own colors flying from his lance\\r\\ntip, rode beneath the portcullis and out upon the starlit road that led\\r\\nto the summit of the Mountains of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat, the king ape, picked a succulent beetle from the decaying bark\\r\\nof a fallen tree. About him were the great, savage people of his tribe.\\r\\nIt was afternoon and the apes loafed in the shade of great trees\\r\\nbeside a little natural clearing in the jungle. They were content and\\r\\nat peace with all the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing toward them were three people, but the wind blew from the apes\\r\\ntoward the people and so neither Toyat nor any of his fellows caught\\r\\nthe scent spoor of the Tarmangani. The jungle trail was soft with damp\\r\\nmold, for it had rained the night before, and the feet of the three\\r\\ngave forth no sound that the apes heard. Then, too, the three were\\r\\nmoving cautiously for they had not eaten for two days and they were\\r\\nhunting for food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a gray old man, emaciated by fever, tottering along with the\\r\\naid of a broken tree branch; there was a wicked-eyed Beduin carrying\\r\\na long musket; and the third was a girl whose strange garments of\\r\\nsplendid stuffs were torn and soiled. Her face was streaked with dirt\\r\\nand was drawn and thin, yet still it was a face of almost heavenly\\r\\nbeauty. She walked with an effort, and though she sometimes stumbled\\r\\nfrom weariness never did she lose a certain regalness of carriage, nor\\r\\nlower the haughty elevation of her well moulded chin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beduin was in the lead. It was he who first sighted a young ape\\r\\nplaying at the edge of the clearing, farthest from the great bulls of\\r\\nthe tribe of Toyat. Here was food! The Beduin raised his ancient weapon\\r\\nand took aim. He pressed the trigger and the ensuing roar mingled with\\r\\nthe scream of pain and terror that burst from the wounded balu.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the great bulls leaped to action. Would they flee the feared\\r\\nand hated thunder stick of the Tarmangani, or would they avenge the\\r\\nhurting of the balu? Who might know? Today they might do the one,\\r\\ntomorrow, under identical circumstances, the other. Today they chose\\r\\nvengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nLed by Toyat, growling hideously, the bulls lumbered forward to\\r\\ninvestigate. It was this sight that met the horrified gaze of the three\\r\\nas they followed up Fahd\\'s shot to learn if at last they were to eat\\r\\nor if they must plod on hopelessly, weakened by the hunger gnawing at\\r\\ntheir vitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nFahd and Stimbol turned and bolted back down the trail, the Arab, in\\r\\nhis cowardly haste, pushing Guinalda to one side and hurling her to\\r\\nthe ground. The leading bull, seeing the girl, leaped upon her and was\\r\\nabout to sink his teeth into her neck when Toyat seized him and dragged\\r\\nhim from her, for Toyat had recognized her for what she was. The king\\r\\nape had once seen another Tarmangani she and had decided that he would\\r\\nlike to have one as a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other ape, a huge bull, seeing that Toyat wanted the prey and\\r\\nangered by the bullying manner of the king, immediately decided to\\r\\ncontest Toyat\\'s right to what he had first claimed. Baring his fangs he\\r\\nadvanced menacingly toward Toyat who had dragged the girl back into the\\r\\nclearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat snarled back at him. \"Go away,\" said Toyat. \"This is Toyat\\'s she.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Go-yad\\'s,\" replied the other, advancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat turned back. \"I kill!\" he screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo-yad came on and suddenly Toyat seized Guinalda in his hairy arms\\r\\nand fled into the jungle. Behind him, bellowing and screaming, pursued\\r\\nGo-yad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess Guinalda, wide-eyed with horror, fought to free herself\\r\\nfrom the hideous, hairy creature that was bearing her off. She had\\r\\nnever seen nor even heard of such a thing as a great ape, and she\\r\\nthought them now some hideous, low inhabitant of that outer world\\r\\nthat she had always been taught consisted of encircling armies of\\r\\nSaracens and beyond and at a great distance a wonderful country known\\r\\nas England. What else was there she had not even tried to guess, but\\r\\nevidently it was a horrid place peopled by hideous creatures, including\\r\\ndragons.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat had run no great distance when he realized that he could not\\r\\nescape while burdened with the she, and as he had no mind to give her\\r\\nup he turned suddenly and faced the roaring Go-yad. Go-yad did not\\r\\nstop. He came on frothing at the mouth, bristling, snarling--a picture\\r\\nof bestial savagery, power and frenzied rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat, relinquishing his hold upon the girl, advanced to meet the\\r\\ncharge of his rebellious subject, while Guinalda, weakened by\\r\\nunaccustomed exertion and lack of nourishment, appalled by the hideous\\r\\ncircumstances of her plight, sank panting to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat and Go-yad, immersed in the prospect of battle, were oblivious\\r\\nto all else. Could Guinalda have taken advantage of this temporary\\r\\nforgetfulness of her she might have escaped; but she was too stunned,\\r\\ntoo exhausted to take advantage of her opportunity. Spellbound,\\r\\nfascinated by the horror of it, she watched these terrifying,\\r\\nprimordial man-beasts preparing to do battle for possession of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was Guinalda the sole witness of these savage preliminaries. From\\r\\nthe concealment of a low bush behind which he lay another watched the\\r\\nscene with steady, interested eyes. Absorbed by their own passion\\r\\nneither Toyat nor Go-yad noted the occasional movement of the outer\\r\\nleaves of the bush behind which this other watcher lay, a movement\\r\\nimparted by the body of the watcher with each breath and with each\\r\\nslightest change of position.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the watcher discovered no sporting interest in the impending\\r\\nduel, for just as the two apes were about to engage he arose and\\r\\nstepped into the open--a great black-maned lion, whose yellow coat\\r\\ngleamed golden in the sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat saw him first and with a growl of rage turned and fled, leaving\\r\\nhis adversary and their prize to whatever fate Providence might hold in\\r\\nstore for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo-yad, thinking his rival had abandoned the field through fear of\\r\\nhim, beat loudly upon his breast and roared forth the victory cry of\\r\\nthe bull ape, then, swaggering as became a victor and a champion, he\\r\\nturned to claim the prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween himself and the girl he saw the lion standing, gazing with\\r\\nserious mien straight into his eyes. Go-yad halted. Who would not\\r\\nhave? The lion was within springing distance but he was not crouched.\\r\\nGo-yad backed away, snarling, and when the lion made no move to follow,\\r\\nthe great ape suddenly turned and lumbered off into the jungle,\\r\\ncasting many a backward glance in the direction of the great cat until\\r\\nintervening foliage shut him from his view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the lion turned toward the girl. Poor little Princess! Hopeless,\\r\\nresigned, she lay upon the ground staring, wide-eyed, at this new\\r\\nengine of torture and destruction. The king of beasts surveyed her for\\r\\na moment and then walked toward her. Guinalda clasped her hands and\\r\\nprayed--not for life, for hope of that she had long since resigned, but\\r\\nfor death, speedy and painless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tawny beast came close. Guinalda closed her eyes to shut out the\\r\\nfearsome sight. She felt hot breath upon her cheek, its fetid odor\\r\\nassailed her nostrils. The lion sniffed about her. God! why did he not\\r\\nend it? Tortured nerves could endure no more and Guinalda swooned.\\r\\nMerciful surcease of her suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n                             _Jad-bal-ja_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNerve shaken, the remnants of Ibn Jad\\'s company turned toward the west\\r\\nand hastened by forced marches to escape the hideous forest of the\\r\\njin. Abd el-Aziz and those who had accompanied him from the Wood of\\r\\nthe Leopards toward Nimmr had not rejoined them. Nor ever would they,\\r\\nfor upon the plain below the treasure city of the Beduins\\' dreaming\\r\\nthe knights of Gobred had discovered them and, despite the thundering\\r\\nhavoc of the ancient matchlocks, the iron Knights of Nimmr had couched\\r\\ntheir spears against the Saracens and once again the victorious cri de\\r\\nguerre of the Crusaders had rung out after seven centuries of silence\\r\\nto announce a new engagement in the hoary war for the possession of the\\r\\nHoly Land--the war that is without end.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the north a mailed knight rode down through the forests of Galla\\r\\nland. A blue and silver pennon fluttered from his lance. The housings\\r\\nof his great charger were rich with gold and silver from the treasure\\r\\nvaults of Wildred of the Sepulcher. Wide-eyed Galla warriors viewed\\r\\nthis solitary anachronism from afar, and fled.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan of the Apes, ranging westward, came upon the spoor of Fahd and\\r\\nStimbol and Guinalda and followed it toward the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthward marched a hundred ebon giants, veterans of a hundred\\r\\nbattles--the famed Waziri--and with them came Zeyd, the lover of Ateja.\\r\\nOne day they came upon a fresh spoor crossing their line of march\\r\\ndiagonally toward the southwest. It was the spoor of Arab sandals,\\r\\nthose of two men and a woman, and when the Waziri pointed them out\\r\\nto Zeyd the young Beduin swore that he recognized those of the woman\\r\\nas belonging to Ateja, for who knew better the shape and size of her\\r\\nlittle foot, or the style of the sandals she fabricated? He begged the\\r\\nWaziri to turn aside for a time and aid him in finding his sweetheart,\\r\\nand while the sub-chief was debating the question in his mind the sound\\r\\nof something hurrying through the jungle attracted the attention of\\r\\nevery ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they listened a man staggered into view. It was Fahd. Zeyd\\r\\nrecognized him instantly and as immediately became doubly positive that\\r\\nthe footprints of the woman had been made by Ateja.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeyd approached Fahd menacingly. \"Where is Ateja?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should I know? I have not seen her for days,\" replied Fahd,\\r\\ntruthfully enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou liest!\" cried Zeyd, and pointed at the ground. \"Here are her own\\r\\nfootprints beside thine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA cunning expression came into the eyes of Fahd. Here he saw an\\r\\nopportunity to cause suffering to the man he hated. He shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wellah, if you know, you know,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she?\" demanded Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is dead. I would have spared you,\" answered Fahd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dead?\" The suffering in that single word should have melted a heart of\\r\\nstone--but not Fahd\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stole her from her father\\'s beyt,\" continued Fahd, wishing to\\r\\ninflict as much torture as possible upon his rival. \"For days and\\r\\nnights she was mine; then a huge ape stole her from me. By now she must\\r\\nbe dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fahd had gone too far. He had encompassed his own undoing. With a\\r\\nscream of rage Zeyd leaped upon him with drawn khusa, and before the\\r\\nWaziri could interfere or Fahd defend himself the keen blade had drunk\\r\\nthrice in the heart of the lying Beduin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith bent head and dull eyes Zeyd marched on northward with the Waziri,\\r\\nas, a mile behind them, a wasted old man, burning with fever, stumbled\\r\\nin the trail and fell. Twice he tried to regain his feet, only to\\r\\nsink weakly back to earth. A filthy, ragged bundle of old bones, he\\r\\nlay--sometimes raving in delirium, sometimes so still that he seemed\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown from the north came Tarzan of the Apes upon the spoor of Guinalda\\r\\nand the two who had accompanied her. Knowing well the windings of the\\r\\ntrail he took short cuts, swinging through the branches of the trees,\\r\\nand so it happened that he missed the Waziri at the point where their\\r\\ntrail had encountered that of Fahd, where Zeyd had slain his rival,\\r\\nand presently his nostrils picked up the scent of the Mangani in the\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the great apes he made his way swiftly for he feared that harm\\r\\nmight befall the girl should she, by any mischance, fall into the\\r\\nhands of the anthropoids. He arrived in the clearing where they lazed,\\r\\na short time after the return of Toyat and Go-yad, who, by now, had\\r\\nabandoned their quarrel, since the prize had been taken by one stronger\\r\\nthan either of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preliminaries of meeting over and the apes having recognized and\\r\\nacknowledged Tarzan, he demanded if any had seen the Tarmangani she who\\r\\nhad recently passed through the jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\'walat pointed at Toyat and Tarzan turned toward the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen the she?\" demanded Tarzan, fearful, for he did not like\\r\\nthe manner of the king ape.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat jerked a thumb toward the south. \"Numa,\" he said and went on\\r\\nhunting for food, but Tarzan knew what the ape meant as surely as\\r\\nthough he had spoken a hundred words of explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\" asked Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\nToyat pointed straight to where he had abandoned Guinalda to the lion,\\r\\nand the ape-man, moving straight through the jungle along the line\\r\\nindicated by the king ape, went sadly to investigate, although he\\r\\nalready guessed what he would find. At least he could drive Numa from\\r\\nhis kill and give decent burial to the unfortunate girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly consciousness returned to Guinalda. She did not open her eyes,\\r\\nbut lay very quiet wondering if this was death. She felt no pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a sickly sweet and pungent odor assailed her nostrils and\\r\\nsomething moved very close to her, so close that she felt it against\\r\\nher body, pressing gently, and where it pressed she felt heat as from\\r\\nanother body.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearfully she opened her eyes and the horror of her predicament again\\r\\nswept over her for she saw that the lion had lain down almost against\\r\\nher. His back was toward her, his noble head was lifted, his black mane\\r\\nalmost brushed her face. He was looking off, intently, toward the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinalda lay very quiet. Presently she felt, rather than heard, a low\\r\\nrumbling growl that seemed to have its origin deep in the cavernous\\r\\nchest of the carnivore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething was coming! Even Guinalda sensed that, but it could not be\\r\\nsuccor, for what could succor her from this hideous beast?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a rustling among the branches of the trees a hundred feet\\r\\naway and suddenly the giant figure of a demigod dropped to the ground.\\r\\nThe lion rose and faced the man. The two stood thus, eyeing one another\\r\\nfor a brief moment. Then the man spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jad-bal-ja!\" he exclaimed, and then: \"Come to heel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great, golden lion whined and strode across the open space,\\r\\nstopping before the man. Guinalda saw the beast look up into the face\\r\\nof the demigod and saw the latter stroke the tawny head affectionately,\\r\\nbut meanwhile the eyes of the man, or god, or whatever he was, were\\r\\nupon Guinalda and she saw the sudden relief that came to them as Tarzan\\r\\nrealized that the girl was unharmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the lion the ape-man crossed to where the princess lay and\\r\\nknelt beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are the Princess Guinalda?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl nodded, wondering how he knew her. As yet she was too stunned\\r\\nto command her own voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be afraid,\" he assured her in a gentle voice. \"I am your\\r\\nfriend. You are safe now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something in the way he said it that filled Guinalda with\\r\\nsuch a sense of safety as all the mailed knights of her father\\'s realm\\r\\nhad scarce imparted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid--any more,\" she said simply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are your companions?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told him all that had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are well rid of them,\" said the ape-man, \"and we shall not attempt\\r\\nto find them. The jungle will account for them in its own way and in\\r\\nits own good time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who art thou?\" asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Tarzan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How didst thou know my name?\" she queried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a friend of one whom you know as Sir James,\" he explained. \"He\\r\\nand I were searching for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art his friend?\" she cried. \"Oh, sweet sir, then thou art mine as\\r\\nwell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ape-man smiled. \"Always!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did the lion not kill thee, Sir Tarzan?\" she demanded, thinking\\r\\nhim a simple knight, for in her land there were only these beside the\\r\\nmembers of her princely house and the pseudo king of the City of the\\r\\nSepulcher. For in the original company that had been wrecked upon\\r\\nthe coast of Africa at the time of the Third Crusade there were only\\r\\nknights, except one bastard son of Henry II, who had been the original\\r\\nPrince Gobred. Never having been in contact with an English king since\\r\\nthey parted from Richard at Cyprus no Gobred had assumed the right to\\r\\nissue patents of nobility to his followers, solely the prerogative of\\r\\nthe king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did the lion not kill me?\" repeated Tarzan. \"Because he is\\r\\nJad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, which I raised from cubhood. All his life\\r\\nhe has known me only as friend and master. He would not harm me and it\\r\\nwas because of his lifelong association with human beings that he did\\r\\nnot harm you; though I was fearful when I saw him beside you that he\\r\\nhad, for a lion is always a lion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou dwellest nearby?\" asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Far away,\" said Tarzan, \"but there must be some of my people nearby,\\r\\nelse Jad-bal-ja would not be here. I sent for my warriors and doubtless\\r\\nhe has accompanied them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding that the girl was hungry Tarzan bade the Golden Lion remain and\\r\\nguard her while he went in search of food.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not fear him,\" he told her, \"and remember that you could not have a\\r\\nprotector more competent than he to discourage the approach of enemies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And well mayst I believe it,\" admitted Guinalda.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan returned with food and then, as the day was not done, he started\\r\\nback toward Nimmr with the rescued girl, carrying her, as she was now\\r\\ntoo weak to walk; and beside them strode the great, black-maned lion of\\r\\ngold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring that journey Tarzan learned much of Nimmr and also discovered\\r\\nthat Blake\\'s love for his princess was apparently fully reciprocated\\r\\nby the girl, for she seemed never so content as when talking about her\\r\\nSir James and asking questions concerning his far country and his past\\r\\nlife, of which, unfortunately, Tarzan could tell her nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the second day the three came to the great cross and here Tarzan\\r\\nhailed the warders and bade them come and take their princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe urged the ape-man to accompany her to the castle and receive the\\r\\nthanks of her father and mother, but he told her that he must leave at\\r\\nonce to search for Blake, and at that she ceased her urging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' thou findst him,\" she said, \"tell him that the gates of Nimmr be\\r\\nalways open to him and that the Princess Guinalda awaits his return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDown from the Cross went Tarzan and Jad-bal-ja and before she turned\\r\\nback to enter the tunnel that led to her father\\'s castle the Princess\\r\\nGuinalda stood watching them until a turn in the trail hid them from\\r\\nher view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May Our Lord Jesus bless thee, sweet sir knight,\" she murmured, \"and\\r\\nwatch o\\'er thee and fetch thee back once more with my beloved!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n                          _Where Trails Met_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDown through the forest rode Blake searching for some clew to the\\r\\nwhereabouts of the Arabs, ranging this way and that, following trails\\r\\nand abandoning them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate one day he came suddenly into a large clearing where once a native\\r\\nvillage had stood. The jungle had not yet reclaimed it and as he\\r\\nentered it he saw a leopard crouching upon the far side, and before the\\r\\nleopard lay the body of a human being. At first Blake thought the poor\\r\\ncreature dead, but presently he saw it attempt to rise and crawl away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great cat growled and advanced toward it. Blake shouted and spurred\\r\\nforward, but Sheeta paid no attention to him, evidently having no mind\\r\\nto give up its prey; but as Blake came nearer the cat turned to face\\r\\nhim with an angry growl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American wondered if his horse would dare the close proximity of\\r\\nthe beast of prey, but he need not have feared. Nor would he had he\\r\\nbeen more fully acquainted with the customs of the Valley of the\\r\\nSepulcher, where one of the greatest sports of the knights of the two\\r\\nenemy cities is hunting the giant cats with lance alone when they\\r\\nventure from the sanctuary of the Wood of the Leopards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charger that Blake bestrode had faced many a savage cat, and\\r\\nlarger, too, by far than this one, and so he fell into his charging\\r\\nstride with no show of fear or nervousness and the two thundered down\\r\\nupon Sheeta while the creature that was to have been its prey looked on\\r\\nwith wide, astounded eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the length of its spring Sheeta rose swiftly to meet the horse\\r\\nand man. He leaped and as he leaped he struck full on the metal tip of\\r\\nthe great lance, and the wooden shaft passed through him so far that\\r\\nit was with difficulty that the man forced the carcass from it. When\\r\\nhe had done so he turned and rode to the side of the creature lying\\r\\nhelpless on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God!\" he cried as his eyes rested on the face below him. \"Stimbol!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe younger man dismounted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m dying, Blake,\" whispered Stimbol. \"Before I go I want to tell you\\r\\nthat I\\'m sorry. I acted like a cad. I guess I\\'ve got what was coming to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind that, Stimbol,\" said Blake. \"You\\'re not dead yet. The first\\r\\nthing is to get you where there are food and water.\" He stooped and\\r\\nlifted the emaciated form and placed the man in his saddle. \"I passed\\r\\na small native village a few miles back. They all ran when they saw me,\\r\\nbut we\\'ll try there for food.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Stimbol. \"And, in the name of King\\r\\nArthur, where did you get the outfit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you about it when we get to the village,\" said Blake. \"It\\'s\\r\\na long story. I\\'m looking for a girl that was stolen by the Arabs a few\\r\\ndays ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God!\" ejaculated Stimbol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know something about her?\" demanded Blake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was with the man that stole her,\" said Stimbol, \"or at least who\\r\\nstole her from the other Arabs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s dead, Blake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bunch of those big anthropoid apes got her. The poor child must have\\r\\nbeen killed immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake was silent for a long time, walking with bowed head as, weighted\\r\\ndown by heavy armor, he led the horse along the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did the Arabs harm her?\" he asked presently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Stimbol. \"The sheik stole her either for ransom or to sell\\r\\nher in the north, but Fahd stole her for himself. He took me along\\r\\nbecause I had promised him a lot of money if he\\'d save me, and I kept\\r\\nhim from harming the girl by telling him that he\\'d never get a cent\\r\\nfrom me if he did. I felt sorry for the poor child and I made up my\\r\\nmind that I was going to save her if I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Blake and Stimbol approached the village the blacks fled, leaving\\r\\nthe white men in full possession of the place. It did not take Blake\\r\\nlong to find food for them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking Stimbol as comfortable as possible, Blake found fodder for\\r\\nhis horse and presently returned to the old man. He was engaged in\\r\\nnarrating his experiences when he was suddenly aware of the approach of\\r\\nmany people. He could hear voices and the pad of naked feet. Evidently\\r\\nthe villagers were returning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake prepared to meet them with friendly overtures, but the first\\r\\nglimpse he had of the approaching party gave him a distinct shock, for\\r\\nthese were not the frightened villagers he had seen scurrying into the\\r\\njungle a short time before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith white plumes waving above their heads a company of stalwart\\r\\nwarriors came swinging down the trail. Great oval shields were upon\\r\\ntheir backs, long war spears in their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Blake, \"I guess we\\'re in for it. The villagers must have\\r\\nsent for their big brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warriors entered the village and when they saw Blake they halted\\r\\nin evident wonder. One of their number approached him and to Blake\\'s\\r\\nsurprise addressed him in fairly good English.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are the Waziri of Tarzan,\" he said. \"We search for our chief and\\r\\nmaster. Have you seen him, Bwana?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waziri! Blake could have hugged them. He had been at his wits end\\r\\nto know what he was to do with Stimbol. Alone he never could have\\r\\nbrought the man to civilization, but now he knew that his worries were\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad it not been for the grief of Blake and Zeyd, it had been a merry\\r\\nparty that made free with the cassava and beer of the villagers that\\r\\nnight, for the Waziri were not worrying about their chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tarzan cannot die,\" said the sub-chief to Blake, when the latter asked\\r\\nif the other felt any fear as to the safety of his master, and the\\r\\nsimple conviction of the quiet words almost succeeded in convincing\\r\\nBlake of their truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the trail plodded the weary \\'Aarab of the Beny Salem fendy,\\r\\nel-Guad. Tired men staggered beneath the weight of half-loads. The\\r\\nwomen carried even more. Ibn Jad watched the treasure with greedy eyes.\\r\\nAn arrow came from nowhere and pierced the heart of a treasure bearer\\r\\nclose before Ibn Jad. A hollow voice sounded from the jungle: \"_For\\r\\nevery jewel a drop of blood!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified, the Beduins hastened on. Who would be next? They wanted\\r\\nto cast aside the treasure, but Ibn Jad, greedy, would not let them.\\r\\nBehind them they caught a glimpse of a great lion. He terrified them\\r\\nbecause he did not come nearer or go away--he just stalked silently\\r\\nalong behind. There were no stragglers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour passed. The lion paced just within sight of the tail end of the\\r\\ncolumn. Never had the head of one of Ibn Jad\\'s columns been so much in\\r\\ndemand. Everyone wished to go in the lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nA scream burst from another treasure carrier. An arrow had passed\\r\\nthrough his lungs. \"_For every jewel a drop of blood!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men threw down the treasure. \"We will not carry the accursed thing\\r\\nmore!\" they cried, and again the voice spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Take up the treasure, Ibn Jad!_\" it said. \"_Take up the treasure! It\\r\\nis thou who murdered to acquire it. Pick it up, thief and murderer, and\\r\\ncarry it thyself!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether the \\'Aarab made the treasure into one load and lifted it to\\r\\nIbn Jad\\'s back. The old sheik staggered beneath the weight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot carry it!\" he cried aloud. \"I am old and I am not strong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Thou canst carry it, or--die!_\" boomed the hollow voice, while the\\r\\nlion stood in the trail behind them, his eyes glaring fixedly at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad staggered on beneath the great load. He could not now travel\\r\\nas fast as the others and so he was left behind with only the lion as\\r\\ncompany; but only for a short time. Ateja saw his predicament and came\\r\\nback to his side, bearing a musket in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fear not,\" she said, \"I am not the son thou didst crave, but yet I\\r\\nshall protect thee even as a son!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was almost dusk when the leaders of the Beduin company stumbled upon\\r\\na village. They were in it and surrounded by a hundred warriors before\\r\\nthey realized that they were in the midst of the one tribe of all\\r\\nothers they most feared and dreaded--the Waziri of Tarzan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sub-chief disarmed them at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Ibn Jad?\" demanded Zeyd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He cometh!\" said one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked back along the trail and presently Zeyd saw two figures\\r\\napproaching. One was a man bent beneath a great load and the other was\\r\\nthat of a young girl. What he did not see was the figure of a great\\r\\nlion in the shadows behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeyd held his breath because, for an instant, his heart had stopped\\r\\nbeating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ateja!\" he cried and ran forward to meet her and clasp her in his arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIbn Jad staggered into the village. He took one look at the stern\\r\\nvisages of the dread Waziri and sank weakly to the ground, the treasure\\r\\nalmost burying him as it fell upon his head and shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nHirfa voiced a sudden scream as she pointed back along the trail, and\\r\\nas every eye turned in that direction, a great golden lion stepped\\r\\ninto the circle of the firelight in the village, and at its side strode\\r\\nTarzan, Lord of the Jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Tarzan entered the village Blake came forward and grasped his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were too late!\" said the American sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Princess Guinalda is dead!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Tarzan. \"I left her this morning at the entrance\\r\\nto the City of Nimmr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA dozen times Tarzan was forced to assure Blake that he was not playing\\r\\na cruel joke upon him. A dozen times Tarzan had to repeat Guinalda\\'s\\r\\nmessage: \"An\\' thou findst him tell him that the gates of Nimmr be\\r\\nalways open to him and that the Princess Guinalda awaits his return!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the evening Stimbol, through Blake, begged Tarzan to come to\\r\\nthe hut in which he lay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed the old man fervently. \"I thought that I had\\r\\nkilled you. It has preyed on my mind and now I know that it was not you\\r\\nI believe that I can recover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will be taken care of properly, Stimbol,\" said the ape-man, \"and\\r\\nas soon as you are well enough you will be taken to the coast,\" then he\\r\\nwalked away. He would do his duty by the man who had disobeyed him and\\r\\ntried to kill him, but he would not feign a friendship he did not feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning they prepared to leave the village. Ibn Jad and\\r\\nhis Arabs, with the exception of Zeyd and Ateja, who had asked to come\\r\\nand serve Tarzan in his home, were being sent to the nearest Galla\\r\\nvillage under escort of a dozen Waziri. Here they would be turned over\\r\\nto the Galla and doubtless sold into slavery in Abyssinia.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimbol was borne in a litter by four stout Waziri as the party\\r\\nprepared to take up its march toward the south and the country of\\r\\nTarzan. Four others carried the treasure of the City of the Sepulcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake, dressed again in his iron mail, bestrode his great charger as\\r\\nthe column started out of the village and down the trail into the\\r\\nsouth. Tarzan and the Golden Lion stood beside him. Blake reached down\\r\\nand extended his hand to the ape-man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, sir!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye?\" demanded Tarzan. \"Aren\\'t you coming home with us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"I\\'m going back into the middle ages with the woman I\\r\\nlove!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTarzan and Jad-bal-ja stood in the trail watching as Sir James rode out\\r\\ntoward the City of Nimmr, the blue and silver of his pennon fluttering\\r\\nbravely from the iron tip of his great lance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                THE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TARZAN, LORD OF THE JUNGLE ***\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n"
